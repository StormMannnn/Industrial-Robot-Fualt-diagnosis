When critical components of machinery fail, it indicates that the equipment has entered a state of malfunction. Machine failures are inherently linked to the failure of mechanical parts. Given the wide variety of mechanical equipment types, along with significant differences in operating conditions and environmental factors, the failure modes of mechanical components also vary widely. Among these, the four most common and representative failure modes are wear, corrosion, deformation, and fracture.\n1.3.1 Wear of Mechanical Components\nWear of mechanical components is the primary failure mode for parts. In typical mechanical equipment, approximately 80% of failed or scrapped components are due to wear-related issues.

Therefore, during installation, avoid placing the PLC directly above components that generate significant heat, and ensure adequate clearance around the PLC to facilitate proper ventilation and heat dissipation. If conditions permit, you can install a fan inside the control cabinet and use a filter screen to draw in ambient air, helping to reduce the overall working environment temperature.
