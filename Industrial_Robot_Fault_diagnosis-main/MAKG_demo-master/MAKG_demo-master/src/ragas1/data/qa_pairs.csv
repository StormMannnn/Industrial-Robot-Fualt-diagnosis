How does the fit system for rolling bearings differ from standard cylindrical tolerance systems?,"['Rolling bearings are standard components, and the fit between the bearing bore and the shaft follows the hole basis system, while the fit between the outer ring and the bearing housing uses the shaft basis system.', 'Since the tolerance zone for the bearing inner diameter lies below the zero line, whereas in cylindrical tolerance standards, the tolerance zone for the reference hole is above the zero line, the interference fit between the inner ring and the journal is significantly tighter than the corresponding hole-basis fits specified in cylindrical tolerance standards.']","The fit system for rolling bearings differs from standard cylindrical tolerance systems in its basis and tolerance zone placement. For rolling bearings, the fit between the bearing bore (inner ring) and the shaft follows the hole basis system, meaning the shaft is selected to fit the bearing's hole. Conversely, the fit between the outer ring and the housing uses the shaft basis system, where the housing is selected to fit the bearing's outer diameter. Additionally, the tolerance zone for the bearing's inner diameter is positioned below the zero line, unlike standard cylindrical tolerance systems where the reference hole's tolerance zone is above the zero line. This results in interference fits between the inner ring and journal being significantly tighter than those specified in standard hole-basis fits, ensuring a more secure connection suitable for bearing applications.",text-EN.txt,107,,
What are the load distribution characteristics for pure axial and radial loads in rolling bearings?,"['Pure axial load: Rolling elements are evenly loaded.', 'Radial load: Uneven loading of rolling elements (loaded and unloaded zones).']","Under pure axial load conditions, all rolling elements in the bearing experience uniform loading, meaning the force is distributed equally across each element. In contrast, radial load creates an uneven distribution where only certain rolling elements within the loaded zone bear the force, while those in the unloaded zone experience minimal or no load, resulting in asymmetric stress patterns.",text-EN.txt,108,,
