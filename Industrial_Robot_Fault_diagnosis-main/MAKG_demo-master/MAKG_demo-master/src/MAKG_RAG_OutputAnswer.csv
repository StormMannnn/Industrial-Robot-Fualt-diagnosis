1.1.1 Meaning of the Failure Typically, a failure is defined as a condition in which a device (system) or component has lost its specified functionality. From a systems perspective, failure carries two key meanings: first, it refers to the mechanical system deviating from its normal function. The primary cause of this deviation lies in Chapter 1—Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Electromechanical Equipment. 3 Work conditions (including components) are abnormal, and these types of failures can be resolved by adjusting parameters or repairing the affected parts, allowing the system to return to normal operation. The second scenario is functional failure, where the system continuously deviates from its intended performance, with the degree of deviation steadily worsening—eventually rendering the equipment unable to perform its basic functions. Such situations are classified as failures. Typically, failed individual components can be replaced; however, if critical components fail, it often results in the complete loss of the machine’s functionality. The primary goal of failure analysis is to identify failure modes, uncover underlying failure mechanisms, and develop strategies to minimize failures, ultimately enhancing the reliability and effective utilization of electromechanical equipment.

Review and Discussi on Question 1 What is a fault? What are the two meanings of ""fault""? What are the different classifications of failures? What are the characteristics of the fault? What is the purpose of equipment failure management? What are the main factors that influence the occurrence of failures? What are the common maintenance methods used for mechanical and electrical equipment? What are the basic requirements for maintenance decision-making?
(1) The defined object. This refers to a single machine, a system composed of several individual machines, or a specific component on the equipment. Different objects may experience varying failure conditions at the same time. For instance, on an automated production line, the failure of a single machine can be enough to disable the entire system; however, in a workshop with a clustered machine layout, the failure of one machine would not necessarily be linked to a breakdown affecting the entire workshop. (2) Time-to-failure. This refers to the fact that the probability of a failure increases as time goes on. In addition to using direct units like years, months, days, or hours, time can also be measured by the number of equipment operations, mileage, or cycles. For instance, vehicles typically use total miles driven as their unit of measurement, while gears might be measured by the number of load-bearing cycles they endure. (3) The specified conditions. These refer to the operational and maintenance conditions during equipment operation, the skill level of personnel, environmental factors, and more. Different conditions will lead to different types of failures. (4) The specified function. It depends on the particular issue at hand. For example, in a lathe operating in the same state, damage to the feed screw would be considered a malfunction when it comes to threading operations—but not when machining end faces, since the two scenarios require different functional capabilities from the lathe. (5) A certain degree of failure. This refers to assessing the severity of functional loss from a quantitative perspective. In production practice, to encompass all possible events, a broad definition of failure has been established: ""A failure is an unqualified state."" 1.1.2 Classification of Failures Mechanical and electrical equipment failures can be categorized from various perspectives, with each classification method highlighting a different aspect of the fault. The purpose of categorizing failures is to assess the severity of the incident, analyze its root causes, and ultimately enable more effective, tailored responses to address the specific types of malfunctions. By examining factors such as failure nature, underlying causes, and distinctive characteristics, faults can be grouped into the following categories. By fault nature (1) Intermittent failures. The equipment temporarily loses certain functions, with the faults often caused by external factors affecting the mechanical and electrical systems—such as operator error, climate changes, or inadequate environmental conditions. Once the external interference is removed or the equipment undergoes minor repairs and adjustments, its functionality typically resumes. (2) Permanent failure. Once this type of failure occurs, it can only be restored through manual repair; otherwise, the fault will persist indefinitely. Such failures are typically caused by damage to specific components. 2) By Severity of the Fault (1) Localized failure. A specific part of the机电 equipment is malfunctioning, causing that particular component to lose its functionality while other parts continue to operate as intended—essentially, a partial functional breakdown. (2) Systemic Failure. A failure that results in the complete loss of system functionality—though it may initially appear as a malfunction in a specific component, it ultimately prevents the device from performing its intended function altogether. Case Studies in Diagnostics and Maintenance of Mechatronic Systems. 4
(1) External equipment failure. These failures originate from external devices such as various sensors, switches, actuators, and loads. When these components fail, they directly im pact the system's control functions. Typically, the occurrence of such failures is determined by the quality and lifespan of the equipment itself. (2) System failure. This is a wid espread malfunction that affects the overall operation of the system. System failures can be categorized into permanent faults and transient faults. If restarting the system after  the failure restores it to normal operation, the issue is classified as a transient fault. Conversely, if a restart does not resolve the problem and hardware or software replacemen t is required to restore functionality, the failure is considered permanent. Such failures typically arise from improper system design or prolonged operational life of the system. (3) Hardware failures. These failures primarily involve damage to system modules such as the CPU, memory, power supply, I/O modules, and others—especially I/O modules. Such failure s are usually quite noticeable, and their impact is typically localized.
3) By the rate at which the fault develops (1) Sudden failures. These failures occur unexpectedly and spontaneously, typically independent of the equipment’s usage time. They are often preceded by no obvious warning signs, making them difficult to predict even through early-stage testing or trials. Such failures usually result from a combination of inherent adverse factors within the process system and unpredictable external influences. (2) Gradual failure. These failures develop slowly and typically occur during the later stages of an electromechanical device's useful life. Their likelihood of occurrence is closely tied to the equipment's usage time, and they can often be predicted through early-stage testing or monitoring. Such failures usually result from the gradual progression of issues like corrosion, wear, fatigue, and material aging in the components. 4) By the cause of fault formation (1) Failures caused by operational or management errors, such as using机电 equipment under conditions that deviate from the original design specifications, leading to improper equipment usage. (2) Failures caused by inherent system factors. These typically arise from defects left over from system design or manufacturing—such as residual stresses or localized weak points—or from latent flaws within the materials themselves. Such failures are unpredictable and represent a major cause of sudden, unexpected breakdowns. (3) Natural failures. During the operational and maintenance period, mechanical and electrical equipment may experience failures caused by various external or internal natural factors—such as wear, fracture, corrosion, deformation, creep, aging, and other forms of damage that occur under normal conditions. 5) By the consequences caused by the failure (1) Critical Failure: A failure that endangers personal safety, results in injury or death, causes the scrapping of机电 equipment, or leads to significant financial losses. Examples include frame or body separation, wheel detachment, and complete engine assembly failure. (2) Minor faults. These are issues that affect the normal operation of mechanical and electrical equipment but can be resolved within a relatively short time. Examples include broken drive belts, damaged control handles, cracks or loose welds in sheet metal components, faulty electrical switches, minor leaks, and loose general fasteners. 6) By the period when the fault occurred (1) Early-stage failures. These faults may arise from design, manufacturing, or material defects and typically become apparent shortly after the equipment is first put into operation. Alternatively, certain components—such as gear pairs in gearboxes or other friction-based assemblies—often require an initial ""running-in"" period before their performance gradually improves. Once these early-stage issues are identified, addressed, and optimized, the failure rate tends to decline over time. (2) Failure during the useful life. This refers to failures that occur within a product's effective lifespan, caused by unpredictable, random factors related to both external loads (such as operational conditions) and intrinsic system characteristics (including internal factors like component failures or structural damage). Since equipment typically operates in this condition for most of its lifetime, the failure rate during this period remains relatively constant. Therefore, monitoring and diagnosing failures during this phase is critically important. (3) Late-stage failures (dissipation-phase failures). These typically occur during the latter part of a device's lifespan, often after the equipment has been in use for an extended period—or even beyond its intended service life. Such failures arise due to gradual wear, fatigue, and aging of the equipment's components, leading to a decline in system functionality. Ultimately, this can result in sudden, hazardous, and potentially widespread system breakdowns. During this phase, the failure rate of the equipment tends to increase steadily. To prevent accidents, it’s crucial to monitor and diagnose the system regularly, promptly replacing any identified failing components before they cause a major incident. As illustrated by the classification of these failures, mechanical and electrical equipment malfunctions are often interconnected and can evolve over time—shifting from one type of failure to another. Ultimately, every type of machinery and equipment failure will manifest as a specific issue, underscoring the importance of comprehensive diagnostic and maintenance strategies. 5"

For the fault, the following points should be clarified:
The material condition and characteristics. 1.1.3 Characteristics of the Failure Diversity Various pieces of equipment not only differ in structure and process parameters, but also vary in their manufacturing, installation processes, and operating environments—leading to a wide range of potential failures during operation. Hierarchical Structure Once a device exhibits a certain failure symptom, it becomes necessary to investigate the root cause of the malfunction. However, some failure causes are often deeply rooted—meaning that a higher-level failure stems from a lower-level one, creating a hierarchical pattern. Multifactorial and Correlation The components of the equipment—and even individual devices—are interconnected through mechanical structures or material transfer. If one component or device fails, it can trigger malfunctions in other components or devices as well, highlighting the multifactorial and interconnected nature of failures. Therefore, when diagnosing the root cause of a malfunction, it’s essential to thoroughly consider all relevant factors involved. Delayed Response During operation, equipment components are continuously subjected to factors such as impact, stress, friction, wear, and corrosion, leading to vibrations, displacements, deformations, fatigue, and crack propagation. These processes gradually degrade the equipment's condition—until, at a certain point, the degradation becomes severe enough to result in mechanical malfunctions or even complete loss of functionality. The time-lag inherent in this failure progression underscores the importance of identifying potential issues early on and implementing preventive measures promptly, thereby minimizing the damage that could arise when a failure ultimately occurs. Uncertainty (Ambiguity) A single fault phenomenon can arise from multiple underlying causes; conversely, a single cause may manifest in various fault symptoms. The occurrence of faults, their specific manifestations, quantitative descriptions, and detection analyses all involve inherent uncertainties, thereby complicating the tasks of fault diagnosis and repair.

Rolling bearing: 70°C vs. 40°C (3) The machine tool's feed mechanism should undergo no-load tests at low, medium, and high feed speeds, while the rapid traverse mechanism should be tested under no-load conditions at its maximum rapid-speed setting. (4) During the machine tool's operational test, all mechanisms undergo startup, stopping, braking, automatic motion, gear-shift transitions, and rapid movements. All should be flexible and reliable. (5) All hydraulic, lubrication, and cooling systems must be free of leaks. (6) The pneumatic system and piping must not have any air leaks. (7) The machine tool's safety guards and protective devices must be complete, secure, and function reliably and sensitively. (8) The machine tool's accuracy must be checked both before and after the load test. For machine tools that do not undergo a load test, accuracy verification should be performed after the no-load running test. 2. Precision Inspection of Mechanical Equipment Maintenance After major overhauls of mechanical equipment, acceptance checks are conducted according to established standards, with each type of equipment having its own specific acceptance criteria and inspection methods. Take metal cutting machine tools as an example: the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has established various precision testing standards for different types of machine tools, along with general guidelines for machine tool accuracy verification. Similarly, China has developed its own standards that are either equivalent to or closely aligned with international benchmarks. These standards specify the inspection items, criteria, methods, and tolerances for machine tool accuracy—serving as the fundamental basis for conducting precision tests. Currently, machine tool maintenance is carried out based on both geometric and operational precision standards during acceptance procedures. Inspection of Machine Tool Geometric Accuracy Geometric accuracy of machine tools refers to the precision of the components that ultimately affect the machine's operational accuracy. It encompasses individual accuracies of basic structural elements, positional accuracy between various parts, as well as motion accuracy, positioning accuracy, indexing accuracy, and transmission chain accuracy. Typically, geometric accuracy checks are performed while the machine tool is stationary. Before conducting these inspections, it’s essential to first ensure proper installation and leveling. Follow the machine tool’s instruction manual carefully to install the equipment on a suitable foundation and achieve precise leveling. The primary goal of leveling is to guarantee the machine’s static stability, which facilitates accurate measurements during testing—especially those related to the straightness of machine components. Additionally, national standards have standardized methods for inspecting both geometric and operational accuracy of machine tools, providing a reliable reference for conducting geometric accuracy tests. Machine Tool Testing Since the geometric accuracy of machine tools is checked under static conditions, it cannot fully reflect the quality of machine tool maintenance. To determine  whether a machine tool can maintain its original geometric accuracy under operational conditions and load applications, it must be evaluated through various machine tool tests. Th e key components of machine tool maintenance testing include no-load running tests, load tests, and working precision tests. (1) No-load operation test of the machine tool. The pur pose of the no-load operation test is to further verify the correct functioning of each component of the machine tool. Sex, reliability, ease and normality of operation, as well as  whether the temperature rise and noise levels of each moving component are within acceptable limits. The primary focus of the machine tool's no-load running test is to simultaneou sly check the operational status of relevant parts while testing the spindle and feed speeds. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Mai ntenance 35 Before conducting the no-load operation test of the machine tool, ensure that all major overhaul tasks have been completed and that each repair has met the required qua lity standards. Next, fill all oil reservoirs with lubricant and properly grease all lubrication points. It is crucial to note: Only after completing all necessary preparations in  accordance with the safety operating procedures can you proceed with the no-load tests as outlined by the precision inspection standards specific to the machine tool being used. (2 ) Machine Tool Load Testing. The machine tool load test evaluates whether the machine’s main motion system can achieve the maximum torque and power allowed by the design, as well a s checks if all machine components are functioning properly under these conditions, whether there are any positional changes between parts, and if such changes remain within the pe rmissible limits. Additionally, it ensures that vibrations, noise levels, and temperature rise remain within normal operating ranges. The machine tool load test primarily involves  performing a cutting-load test, where tools and cutting parameters are selected according to specified requirements to machine the surface of test specimens made from a particular  material and in a specific size. During the load test, the spindle speed and feed rate are allowed to deviate by no more than 5% compared to the theoretical values. (3) Machine Too l Working Accuracy Test. The purpose of the machine tool working accuracy test is to determine whether the positional accuracy between the machine’s various components during the m achining process meets the precision requirements of the parts being manufactured. Before the test, its geometric accuracy must be rechecked. The machine tool working accuracy test  involves machining the surface of a specified test piece using cutting tools and appropriate cutting parameters, as outlined in the machine tool accuracy testing standards for wor king precision requirements. The geometric accuracy of the machined workpiece surface must fall within the tolerance range specified by the precision standards of the machine tool  used, and the surface roughness value should not exceed the prescribed standard."

(2) Based on the company’s actual production conditions, equipment status, and specific features, determine the key areas for equipment failure management. (3) Use monitoring instruments and diagnostic techniques to systematically monitor critical equipment, enabling timely detection of fault indicators and deterioration. Information on equipment condition. Typically, equipment can undergo daily inspections, routine patrols, and periodic checks (including precision assessments), as well as integrity assessments—using human senses and common diagnostic tools—to closely monitor the technical status and any unusual signs in components, mechanisms, and areas prone to failure. At the same time, inspection standards should be established to clearly define the boundaries between normal operation, abnormalities, and equipment failures. (4) To quickly locate the fault location and its cause, in addition to providing training to ensure that maintenance and operational staff acquire a solid understanding of electrical and hydraulic technologies, it is also essential to compile common equipment failure symptoms, analysis procedures, and troubleshooting methods into a fault-finding logic flowchart. This will enable operators to swiftly identify the source and root cause of any malfunction after it occurs, allowing for timely diagnosis, repair, and restoration of equipment functionality. (5) Improve the fault recording system. Fault records serve as the foundational data for effective fault management and also provide the original basis for conducting fault analysis and troubleshooting. Records must be complete and accurate. After on-site inspections and fault repairs, maintenance personnel should follow the ""Equipment Carefully complete the  ""Equipment Failure Repair Form "" and submit monthly statistical analyses to the equipment management department. (6) Conduct timely statistics and analysis of equipment failures. In addition to monitoring failur e situations on a daily basis, staff members should compile  ""Failure Repair Forms "" and maintenance records on a monthly basis. By systematically collecting, organizing, and analyzing failure data, it’s possible to calculate the failure frequency and mean time b etween failures for each type of equipment. Furthermore, this process allows for an in-depth analysis of individual equipment failure trends and identifies key root causes, helping  to pinpoint recurring patterns. Armed with this insight, teams can prioritize their response strategies effectively. Finally, the compiled and analyzed failure information should  be shared back with the planning department, enabling them to schedule preventive maintenance or implement improvement measures. This data can also serve as a valuable reference fo r adjusting the intervals, content, and standards of routine inspections. (7) Implement different countermeasures based on the nature of the failure, the type of fault, and the spe cific characteristics of the equipment. For newly acquired equipment, strengthen management during the initial phase of use—carefully monitor and document the equipment’s precision , performance, and any emerging defects from the outset. During operation, emphasize routine maintenance, regular patrol inspections, and periodic checks to promptly identify early  warning signs and take appropriate adjustment or troubleshooting actions. For critical equipment, conduct condition monitoring and diagnostics. Establish a flexible and responsive  maintenance team equipped with advanced technical expertise, employing rapid repair techniques such as component-by-component fixes or group-based replacements. Ensure timely avai lability of high-quality spare parts, leverage production downtime for equipment overhauls, and apply measures like retrofitting or replacing components when wear patterns have bee n thoroughly understood. (8) Carry out routine maintenance tasks effectively to control equipment failures. Utilize status information and early warning signs of potential issues g athered during daily rounds by regional maintenance workers, as well as scheduled equipment condition checks, along with relevant records and analysis data. Based on the specific c haracteristics of each type of equipment and the general defects already identified, the workshop’s equipment mechanic (technician) or maintenance team leader should promptly sched ule routine repairs—ideally during production downtime or weekend slots—to proactively address problems before they escalate, thereby minimizing breakdowns. For certain failure ind icators or hidden risks that exceed the scope of routine maintenance, these should be reported back to the planning department for scheduling dedicated, planned maintenance activit ies instead. (9) Establish a rational fault information management flowchart.
2) Condition Monitoring and Maintenance This is a preventive maintenance approach based on the equipment's tec hnical condition, carried out precisely when needed. It relies on condition monitoring and advanced diagnostic techniques to track the gradual deterioration of equipment over time.  By leveraging highly predictive insights, this method allows for timely scheduling of preventive maintenance activities, which is why it’s also referred to as  ""predictive maintenance. "" At its core, this maintenance strategy integrates comprehensive data from various sources—such as inspections, routine upkeep, operational use, and repair activities—especially insights gained from diagnostics and monitoring. Through rigorous statistical analysis, it accurately assesses the extent of equipment degradation, identifies specific areas where failures may occur (or are likely to occur), and predicts trends in the equipment’s overall technical condition. Armed with this information, operators can then determine the most appropriate type of maintenance intervention. By doing so, organizations gain full control over maintenance activities, ensuring thorough preparation before repairs begin. Moreover, this approach enables seamless coordination with production schedules, maximizing equipment utilization while simultaneously extending the lifespan of critical components. However, this method does come with some drawbacks: it tends to be more expensive and requires sophisticated diagnostic capabilities. Additionally, it demands highly skilled technicians who can interpret complex data and make informed decisions. This approach is particularly well-suited for critical, high-value equipment, key assets on production lines, machinery that cannot be easily disassembled for inspection (such as precision machine tools), and systems whose failure could lead to significant environmental or public health concerns.
1.2.7 Patterns of Failure Occurrence Mechanical and electrical equipment failures exhibit two notable characteristics: first, the likelihood of failure increases as the equipment ages; second, failures occur randomly, making it difficult to predict the exact timing of any given failure. Consequently, over the equipment's lifespan, the probability of a failure can be expressed using statistical methods. The failure rate, denoted by ( \lambda(t) ), represents the conditional probability that a failure will occur within the infinitesimal time interval ( dt ), given that no failure has yet happened up to time ( t ).

3) By the rate at which the fault develops (1) Sudden failures. These failures occur unexpectedly and spontaneously, typically independent of the equipment’s usage time. They are often preceded by no obvious warning signs, making them difficult to predict even through early-stage testing or trials. Such failures usually result from a combination of inherent adverse factors within the process system and unpredictable external influences. (2) Gradual failure. These failures develop slowly and typically occur during the later stages of an electromechanical device's useful life. Their likelihood of occurrence is closely tied to the equipment's usage time, and they can often be predicted through early-stage testing or monitoring. Such failures usually result from the gradual progression of issues like corrosion, wear, fatigue, and material aging in the components. 4) By the cause of fault formation (1) Failures caused by operational or management errors, such as using机电 equipment under conditions that deviate from the original design specifications, leading to improper equipment usage. (2) Failures caused by inherent system factors. These typically arise from defects left over from system design or manufacturing—such as residual stresses or localized weak points—or from latent flaws within the materials themselves. Such failures are unpredictable and represent a major cause of sudden, unexpected breakdowns. (3) Natural failures. During the operational and maintenance period, mechanical and electrical equipment may experience failures caused by various external or internal natural factors—such as wear, fracture, corrosion, deformation, creep, aging, and other forms of damage that occur under normal conditions. 5) By the consequences caused by the failure (1) Critical Failure: A failure that endangers personal safety, results in injury or death, causes the scrapping of机电 equipment, or leads to significant financial losses. Examples include frame or body separation, wheel detachment, and complete engine assembly failure. (2) Minor faults. These are issues that affect the normal operation of mechanical and electrical equipment but can be resolved within a relatively short time. Examples include broken drive belts, damaged control handles, cracks or loose welds in sheet metal components, faulty electrical switches, minor leaks, and loose general fasteners. 6) By the period when the fault occurred (1) Early-stage failures. These faults may arise from design, manufacturing, or material defects and typically become apparent shortly after the equipment is first put into operation. Alternatively, certain components—such as gear pairs in gearboxes or other friction-based assemblies—often require an initial ""running-in"" period before their performance gradually improves. Once these early-stage issues are identified, addressed, and optimized, the failure rate tends to decline over time. (2) Failure during the useful life. This refers to failures that occur within a product's effective lifespan, caused by unpredictable, random factors related to both external loads (such as operational conditions) and intrinsic system characteristics (including internal factors like component failures or structural damage). Since equipment typically operates in this condition for most of its lifetime, the failure rate during this period remains relatively constant. Therefore, monitoring and diagnosing failures during this phase is critically important. (3) Late-stage failures (dissipation-phase failures). These typically occur during the latter part of a device's lifespan, often after the equipment has been in use for an extended period—or even beyond its intended service life. Such failures arise due to gradual wear, fatigue, and aging of the equipment's components, leading to a decline in system functionality. Ultimately, this can result in sudden, hazardous, and potentially widespread system breakdowns. During this phase, the failure rate of the equipment tends to increase steadily. To prevent accidents, it’s crucial to monitor and diagnose the system regularly, promptly replacing any identified failing components before they cause a major incident. As illustrated by the classification of these failures, mechanical and electrical equipment malfunctions are often interconnected and can evolve over time—shifting from one type of failure to another. Ultimately, every type of machinery and equipment failure will manifest as a specific issue, underscoring the importance of comprehensive diagnostic and maintenance strategies. 5
Due to various reasons, the early failure period may reappear after major equipment repairs or upgrades. 2. Random Failure Period During the random failure period, the failure rate remains low and stable, nearly constant. Random failures are caused by偶然 factors—they are unpredictable and cannot be eliminated even by extending the running-in phase. Design flaws, component defects, inadequate maintenance, and improper operation can all lead to random failures. 3. Wear-Out Failure Phase The characteristic of wear-out failures is that the failure rate increases as operating time accumulates. Wear-out failures are caused by factors such as wear fatigue, aging, and corrosion of equipment components. These types of failures typically indicate that the equipment is approaching its major overhaul period or nearing the end of its service life. 1.3 Failure Modes of Mechanical Components and Corresponding Countermeasures During equipment operation, the phenomenon where mechanical components lose their intended functionality due to various factors such as design, materials, manufacturing processes, and assembly—rendering them unable to continue working—is referred to as failure. When critical components of machinery fail, it indicates that the equipment has entered a state of malfunction. Machine failures are inherently linked to the failure of mechanical parts. Given the wide variety of mechanical equipment types, along with significant differences in operating conditions and environmental factors, the failure modes of mechanical components also vary widely. Among these, the four most common and representative failure modes are wear, corrosion, deformation, and fracture. 1.3.1 Wear of Mechanical Components Wear of mechanical components is the primary failure mode for parts. In typical mechanical equipment, approximately 80% of failed or scrapped components are due to wear-related issues. Wear not only reduces the efficiency and reliability of机电设备 but can also lead to premature failure of the equipment itself. Therefore, conducting research into the wear mechanisms of机电设备 can help us understand the specific wear characteristics of various components, providing a solid foundation for developing effective maintenance strategies and schedules—and ultimately extending the service life of the equipment. 1. General Patterns of Part Wear Wear is a microscopic and dynamic process that occurs as parts wear down. Various physical, chemical, and mechanical phenomena occur, along with their external manifestations. The state refers to the wear of the surface material, and the extent of wear is typically measured by abrasion. Measure, measure. Under normal operating conditions, the wear process of the part is divided into 3 stages. Phase, as shown in Figure 1.3, where w represents the wear amount. 1) Fitting-in Phase OA It occurs during the initial phase of equipment use. At this stage, the surfaces of the friction pair exhibit micro-… Observing the wave peaks results in a smaller actual contact area between the parts, leading to increased contact stress.

1.1.4 Management of Failures Equipment failure management is a critical component of overall equipment maintenance. Effectively leveraging the fault information generated during equipment operation—by analyzing data from multiple perspectives and predicting potential failures—and subsequently implementing proactive measures to minimize equipment-related losses are essential for enhancing overall equipment management practices. Establishing a procedure for managing enterprise equipment failures is the first step in building an accident early-warning mechanism, and correctly developing such a procedure is of great significance. To effectively manage equipment failures, it’s essential to thoroughly understand the root causes of breakdowns, systematically collect data and information on common and typical failures, conduct in-depth failure analyses, emphasize research into failure patterns and mechanisms, and strengthen routine maintenance, inspections, and preventive repairs. The purpose of equipment failure management is to monitor and diagnose equipment conditions before failures occur, enabling operators to identify any signs of degradation. This proactive approach aims to detect early warning indicators and potential risks, allowing for timely preventive maintenance to effectively control the occurrence of failures. After a failure does happen, the process involves promptly analyzing the root cause, developing targeted solutions, and implementing measures to either resolve the issue or improve the equipment—ultimately preventing future occurrences.
6 The procedure for equipment failure management is outlined below. (1) Conduct thorough education and awareness campaigns to ensure that operators and maintenance personnel voluntarily comply with relevant rules and regulations regarding operation, maintenance, inspection, etc., properly use and carefully maintain equipment, and diligently record, compile statistics, and analyze any equipment malfunctions. (2) Based on the company’s actual production conditions, equipment status, and specific features, determine the key areas for equipment failure management. (3) Use monitoring instruments and diagnostic techniques to systematically monitor critical equipment, enabling timely detection of fault indicators and deterioration. Information on equipment condition. Typically, equipment can undergo daily inspections, routine patrols, and periodic checks (including precision assessments), as well as integrity assessments—using human senses and common diagnostic tools—to closely monitor the technical status and any unusual signs in components, mechanisms, and areas prone to failure. At the same time, inspection standards should be established to clearly define the boundaries between normal operation, abnormalities, and equipment failures. (4) To quickly locate the fault location and its cause, in addition to providing training to ensure that maintenance and operational staff acquire a solid understanding of electrical and hydraulic technologies, it is also essential to compile common equipment failure symptoms, analysis procedures, and troubleshooting methods into a fault-finding logic flowchart. This will enable operators to swiftly identify the source and root cause of any malfunction after it occurs, allowing for timely diagnosis, repair, and restoration of equipment functionality. (5) Improve the fault recording system. Fault records serve as the foundational data for effective fault management and also provide the original basis for conducting fault analysis and troubleshooting. Records must be complete and accurate. After on-site inspections and fault repairs, maintenance personnel should follow the ""Equipment Carefully complete the  ""Equipment Failure Repair Form "" and submit monthly statistical analyses to the equipment management department. (6) Conduct timely statistics and analysis of equipment failures. In addition to monitoring failure situations on a daily basis, staff members should compile  ""Failure Repair Forms "" and maintenance records on a monthly basis. By systematically collecting, organizing, and analyzing failure data, it’s possible to calculate the failure frequency and mean time between failures for each type of equipment. Furthermore, this process allows for an in-depth analysis of individual equipment failure trends and identifies key root causes, helping  to pinpoint recurring patterns. Armed with this insight, teams can prioritize their response strategies effectively. Finally, the compiled and analyzed failure information should  be shared back with the planning department, enabling them to schedule preventive maintenance or implement improvement measures. This data can also serve as a valuable reference for adjusting the intervals, content, and standards of routine inspections. (7) Implement different countermeasures based on the nature of the failure, the type of fault, and the specific characteristics of the equipment. For newly acquired equipment, strengthen management during the initial phase of use—carefully monitor and document the equipment’s precision , performance, and any emerging defects from the outset. During operation, emphasize routine maintenance, regular patrol inspections, and periodic checks to promptly identify early  warning signs and take appropriate adjustment or troubleshooting actions. For critical equipment, conduct condition monitoring and diagnostics. Establish a flexible and responsive  maintenance team equipped with advanced technical expertise, employing rapid repair techniques such as component-by-component fixes or group-based replacements. Ensure timely availability of high-quality spare parts, leverage production downtime for equipment overhauls, and apply measures like retrofitting or replacing components when wear patterns have been thoroughly understood. (8) Carry out routine maintenance tasks effectively to control equipment failures. Utilize status information and early warning signs of potential issues gathered during daily rounds by regional maintenance workers, as well as scheduled equipment condition checks, along with relevant records and analysis data. Based on the specific characteristics of each type of equipment and the general defects already identified, the workshop’s equipment mechanic (technician) or maintenance team leader should promptly schedule routine repairs—ideally during production downtime or weekend slots—to proactively address problems before they escalate, thereby minimizing breakdowns. For certain failure indicators or hidden risks that exceed the scope of routine maintenance, these should be reported back to the planning department for scheduling dedicated, planned maintenance activities instead. (9) Establish a rational fault information management flowchart.
1.1.5 Key Factors Influencing Failure Generation The more complex the mechanical and electrical equipment, the more diverse the potential causes of failure. The main factors influencing these failures include the following aspects. 1) Design Planning In the design planning phase, accurate estimates of the equipment's future operating conditions are essential, and potential variations should be thoroughly considered.

1.1.4 Management of Failures Equipment failure management is a critical component of overall equipment maintenance. Effectively leveraging the fault information generated during equipment operation—by analyzing data from multiple perspectives and predicting potential failures—and subsequently implementing proactive measures to minimize equipment-related losses are essential for enhancing overall equipment management practices. Establishing a procedure for managing enterprise equipment failures is the first step in building an accident early-warning mechanism, and correctly developing such a procedure is of great significance. To effectively manage equipment failures, it’s essential to thoroughly understand the root causes of breakdowns, systematically collect data and information on common and typical failures, conduct in-depth failure analyses, emphasize research into failure patterns and mechanisms, and strengthen routine maintenance, inspections, and preventive repairs. The purpose of equipment failure management is to monitor and diagnose equipment conditions before failures occur, enabling operators to identify any signs of degradation. This proactive approach aims to detect early warning indicators and potential risks, allowing for timely preventive maintenance to effectively control the occurrence of failures. After a failure does happen, the process involves promptly analyzing the root cause, developing targeted solutions, and implementing measures to either resolve the issue or improve the equipment—ultimately preventing future occurrences.
6 The procedure for equipment failure management is outlined below. (1) Conduct thorough education and awareness campaigns to ensure that operators and maintenance personnel voluntarily comply with relevant rules and regulations regarding operation, maintenance, inspection, etc., properly use and carefully maintain equipment, and diligently record, compile statistics, and analyze any equipment malfunctions. (2) Based on the company’s actual production conditions, equipment status, and specific features, determine the key areas for equipment failure management. (3) Use monitoring instruments and diagnostic techniques to systematically monitor critical equipment, enabling timely detection of fault indicators and deterioration. Information on equipment condition. Typically, equipment can undergo daily inspections, routine patrols, and periodic checks (including precision assessments), as well as integrity assessments—using human senses and common diagnostic tools—to closely monitor the technical status and any unusual signs in components, mechanisms, and areas prone to failure. At the same time, inspection standards should be established to clearly define the boundaries between normal operation, abnormalities, and equipment failures. (4) To quickly locate the fault location and its cause, in addition to providing training to ensure that maintenance and operational staff acquire a solid understanding of electrical and hydraulic technologies, it is also essential to compile common equipment failure symptoms, analysis procedures, and troubleshooting methods into a fault-finding logic flowchart. This will enable operators to swiftly identify the source and root cause of any malfunction after it occurs, allowing for timely diagnosis, repair, and restoration of equipment functionality. (5) Improve the fault recording system. Fault records serve as the foundational data for effective fault management and also provide the original basis for conducting fault analysis and troubleshooting. Records must be complete and accurate. After on-site inspections and fault repairs, maintenance personnel should follow the ""Equipment Carefully complete the  ""Equipment Failure Repair Form "" and submit monthly statistical analyses to the equipment management department. (6) Conduct timely statistics and analysis of equipment failures. In addition to monitoring failur e situations on a daily basis, staff members should compile  ""Failure Repair Forms "" and maintenance records on a monthly basis. By systematically collecting, organizing, and analyzing failure data, it’s possible to calculate the failure frequency and mean time b etween failures for each type of equipment. Furthermore, this process allows for an in-depth analysis of individual equipment failure trends and identifies key root causes, helping  to pinpoint recurring patterns. Armed with this insight, teams can prioritize their response strategies effectively. Finally, the compiled and analyzed failure information should  be shared back with the planning department, enabling them to schedule preventive maintenance or implement improvement measures. This data can also serve as a valuable reference fo r adjusting the intervals, content, and standards of routine inspections. (7) Implement different countermeasures based on the nature of the failure, the type of fault, and the spe cific characteristics of the equipment. For newly acquired equipment, strengthen management during the initial phase of use—carefully monitor and document the equipment’s precision , performance, and any emerging defects from the outset. During operation, emphasize routine maintenance, regular patrol inspections, and periodic checks to promptly identify early  warning signs and take appropriate adjustment or troubleshooting actions. For critical equipment, conduct condition monitoring and diagnostics. Establish a flexible and responsive  maintenance team equipped with advanced technical expertise, employing rapid repair techniques such as component-by-component fixes or group-based replacements. Ensure timely avai lability of high-quality spare parts, leverage production downtime for equipment overhauls, and apply measures like retrofitting or replacing components when wear patterns have bee n thoroughly understood. (8) Carry out routine maintenance tasks effectively to control equipment failures. Utilize status information and early warning signs of potential issues g athered during daily rounds by regional maintenance workers, as well as scheduled equipment condition checks, along with relevant records and analysis data. Based on the specific c haracteristics of each type of equipment and the general defects already identified, the workshop’s equipment mechanic (technician) or maintenance team leader should promptly sched ule routine repairs—ideally during production downtime or weekend slots—to proactively address problems before they escalate, thereby minimizing breakdowns. For certain failure ind icators or hidden risks that exceed the scope of routine maintenance, these should be reported back to the planning department for scheduling dedicated, planned maintenance activit ies instead. (9) Establish a rational fault information management flowchart.
6. Develop effective operating procedures, establish a sound e quipment usage accountability system, and strictly adhere to them during operation. Establishing and adhering to operating procedures is one of the key measures to ensure the safe  operation of equipment. Leaders at all levels within the enterprise, as well as equipment management departments, production team leaders, and production workers, all bear correspo nding responsibilities in ensuring the proper use of equipment. Practical experience has shown that many equipment failures can be significantly reduced simply by following establi shed operating procedures. 7. Pre-employment Training for Operators Operators must be thoroughly familiar with and proficient in the equipment’s performance, structure, processing  capabilities, and maintenance procedures. New operators are required to undergo a technical assessment before operating the machine; only those who pass can independently perform s etup tasks. For precision, complex, or critical production equipment, designated operators with specialized expertise should be assigned—adhering to the principle of  ""designated personnel for specific machines, operating only with proper certification. "" Additionally, employees should receive ongoing education and training on the proper use and care of equipment. The level of care operators demonstrate toward machinery directly i mpacts the equipment’s lifespan and operational efficiency. Therefore, companies must regularly provide employees with both ideological guidance and technical training, equipping t hem with the skills needed to diagnose and troubleshoot mechanical and electrical system failures effectively."

6) Use correctly Under normal operating conditions, mechanical equipment follows its own failure patterns; however, when operating conditions change, these failure patterns also shift accordingly. The primary operating conditions include the following: (1) Load. The primary causes of wear and fatigue failure in mechanical equipment are the wear of components and their fatigue-induced damage. Under specified operating conditions, the rate of component wear over a given period is directly proportional to the magnitude of the load applied. Meanwhile, fatigue damage to components occurs only under certain types of cyclic loading and intensifies as the load increases. Thus, both wear and fatigue are functions of the applied load. Exceeding the design-rated load levels can lead to severe failure, which is unacceptable. (2) Environment. The environment includes the effects of climate, corrosive media, and other harmful substances, as well as the condition of the working object itself. Increased temperatures accelerate wear and corrosion, while excessively high humidity and corrosive agents present in the air can lead to both corrosion and corrosive wear. Additionally, excessive dust levels in the air and harsh operating conditions often contribute to equipment failures. However, the environment is an objective factor, and in certain situations, measures can be taken manually to improve it. (3) Maintenance and Operation. Establishing a sound maintenance system and strictly adhering to technical maintenance guidelines and operational procedures are crucial for ensuring the reliable performance of mechanical equipment and extending its service life. Additionally, it is essential to provide training for personnel to enhance their skills and expertise."

The material condition and characteristics. 1.1.3 Characteristics of the Failure Diversity Various pieces of equipment not only differ in structure and process parameters, but also vary in their manufacturing, installation processes, and operating environments—leading to a wide range of potential failures during operation. Hierarchical Structure Once a device exhibits a certain failure symptom, it becomes necessary to investigate the root cause of the malfunction. However, some failure causes are often deeply rooted—meaning that a higher-level failure stems from a lower-level one, creating a hierarchical pattern. Multifactorial and Correlation The components of the equipment—and even individual devices—are interconnected through mechanical structures or material transfer. If one component or device fails, it can trigger malfunctions in other components or devices as well, highlighting the multifactorial and interconnected nature of failures. Therefore, when diagnosing the root cause of a malfunction, it’s essential to thoroughly consider all relevant factors involved. Delayed Response During operation, equipment components are continuously subjected to factors such as impact, stress, friction, wear, and corrosion, leading to vibrations, displacements, deformations, fatigue, and crack propagation. These processes gradually degrade the equipment's condition—until, at a certain point, the degradation becomes severe enough to result in mechanical malfunctions or even complete loss of functionality. The time-lag inherent in this failure progression underscores the importance of identifying potential issues early on and implementing preventive measures promptly, thereby minimizing the damage that could arise when a failure ultimately occurs. Uncertainty (Ambiguity) A single fault phenomenon can arise from multiple underlying causes; conversely, a single cause may manifest in various fault symptoms. The occurrence of faults, their specific manifestations, quantitative descriptions, and detection analyses all involve inherent uncertainties, thereby complicating the tasks of fault diagnosis and repair.

1.2 Basics of Equipment Maintenance 1.2.1 Maintenance Method The method of equipment maintenance carries the meaning of a maintenance strategy. Modern equipment management emphasizes applying different maintenance approaches to various types of equipment, underscoring that equipment repair should align with the objective principles governing the physical lifecycle of machinery and materials. This approach ensures production continuity while optimizing the efficient use of maintenance resources, ultimately achieving the most cost-effective outcome over the equipment's entire lifespan. Commonly used maintenance methods for electromechanical equipment include the following: Reactive Maintenance Post-failure maintenance, also known as breakdown maintenance, damage repair, or unplanned maintenance, refers to repairs carried out after mechanical and electrical equipment has malfunctioned—essentially, ""if it breaks, we fix it."" For certain critical equipment, post-failure maintenance should be minimized whenever possible; however, for devices that have minimal impact on production or are backed up by redundant units, opting for post-failure maintenance is often the most cost-effective approach. Preventive Maintenance Maintenance performed before mechanical and electrical equipment fails is called preventive maintenance. Its main benefits include reducing unexpected equipment failures, ensuring continuous production, integrating equipment upkeep and repair tasks into a structured plan—thereby minimizing unplanned disruptions in production—and ultimately improving equipment utilization, lowering maintenance costs, and extending the equipment's natural lifespan. Preventive maintenance is categorized into two basic forms: Regular maintenance Regular maintenance is also known as planned maintenance or time-based preventive maintenance. It involves carrying out preventive maintenance activities at predetermined intervals and follows a cyclical pattern. This type of maintenance is based on the wear patterns of components, with specific guidelines for setting maintenance intervals, defining maintenance categories, outlining maintenance tasks, and estimating the associated workload. However, this approach to maintenance can lead to certain challenges: First, when equipment is still in good technical condition and fully capable of continuing operation, it may undergo major over-maintenance simply because the scheduled interval has arrived—resulting in unnecessary repairs. Second, if a machine’s technical condition has already deteriorated to the point where it can no longer meet production requirements, but the prescribed maintenance interval hasn’t yet been reached, no repair plan will be implemented, leading to under-maintenance. This method is particularly well-suited for process-oriented production equipment or power systems where the wear patterns are well understood, and operations are stable and contin uous—such as large-scale assembly line equipment or key machinery operating on automated production lines. Currently, China primarily implements two main types of equipment mainten ance systems: the Planned Preventive Maintenance System and the Planned Warranty System. (1) Planned Preventive Maintenance System (referred to as Planned Pre-Maintenance). This sy stem involves maintaining, inspecting, and repairing equipment according to its wear patterns, adhering to predetermined maintenance cycles and procedures, to ensure that the equip ment consistently remains in optimal technical condition. Its key features are outlined below. ① Perform daily cleaning, inspection, lubrication, tightening, and adjustments on equ ipment as required to minimize wear and ensure proper operation. ② Conduct regular inspections and adjustments of the equipment's operational status and wear levels according to th e prescribed schedule, ensuring that potential issues are promptly addressed. This allows you to monitor changes in the equipment's technical condition and adequately prepare the n ecessary resources for scheduled maintenance. ③ Conduct preventive maintenance on equipment in a planned and prepared manner. (2) The Planned Maintenance System (also known as the  Maintenance and Repair System) is a equipment maintenance approach that combines routine upkeep with scheduled inspections and repairs. Its key features are outlined below. ① Based  on the equipment's characteristics and condition, different maintenance categories and intervals are specified according to operational hours (such as production output and mileag e).
Material details, etc. 6. Maintenance-Free Design Maintenance-free design is the ideal goal for equipment maintenance—it refers to implementing improvement measures during the design phase of new machinery and electrical equipment to address common failures encountered during maintenance, aiming to minimize maintenance efforts or even eliminate the need for repairs altogether. 1.2.2 Maintenance Method Selection The purpose of maintenance is to ensure the reliable operation of equipment—specifically, to guarantee the dependable fulfillment of its intended use—and, at the same time, minimize maintenance costs. Therefore, the fundamental requirements for maintenance decisions are: ① Reliability must not fall below the permissible minimum value [R], meaning that ()[] R ≥ R(t); ② Maintenance costs (KI) must be kept as low as possible—or, alternatively, must not exceed a predetermined maintenance cost limit (KImin), i.e., K ≤ KImin. To optimize maintenance decisions, the first step should be to choose an appropriate maintenance approach. The six maintenance methods mentioned above each have a specific scope of applicability; however, their effectiveness can vary depending on how appropriately they are applied. To maximize equipment efficiency, minimize downtime-related losses, and reduce maintenance costs, it’s essential to select the most suitable approach based on the characteristics of mechatronic systems and the conditions under which they are used. Looking ahead, the trend in maintenance practices is shifting from routine preventive maintenance toward planned, periodic inspections—and then, based on inspection findings, scheduling timely condition-based repairs. As the technological sophistication of factory equipment continues to rise, with increasingly complex system designs and broader adoption of mechatronic solutions, production activities are becoming more reliant on equipment performance and reliability. Consequently, the traditional static approach to maintenance management is evolving into a more dynamic model, gradually moving toward advanced strategies such as reliability-centered maintenance and quality-focused repair practices. Mechatronic equipment comes in a wide variety of types and is widely applied, making it essential to select one or a combination of maintenance methods tailored to the specific situation. When choosing a maintenance approach for mechatronic systems, reliability typically becomes the primary focus. For critical components, implementing condition-based monitoring allows for timely preventive measures. Meanwhile, for equipment at quality control points, it’s crucial to closely track changes in product quality during the manufacturing process and promptly address any detected anomalies through quality repairs. Additionally, it’s important to equip teams with personnel who are well-versed in microelectronics technology, providing them with supervision and guidance while fostering the development of skilled, integrated mechatronics technicians. Regular inspections and logical fault analysis should be conducted on CNC and other mechatronic systems, and any failed components identified must be promptly replaced and properly adjusted to ensure optimal performance. 1.2.3 Maintenance System Maintenance work is not only a technical task but also a managerial one. A maintenance system refers to a set of guidelines established under specific maintenance theories and principles, encompassing elements such as maintenance plans, categories, methods, timing, scope, levels, organizational structures, and performance evaluation metrics. Implementing a rational maintenance system helps optimize the allocation of human, material, and financial resources, enabling timely preparation before maintenance tasks, ensuring repairs are carried out appropriately, meeting operational requirements, enhancing the technical condition, reliability, and service life of机电 equipment, reducing downtime, and minimizing maintenance costs and production losses due to equipment shutdowns. Meanwhile, maintenance systems are continuously evolving and improving—currently, the main approaches include the following: Planned Preventive Maintenance System It is based on a thorough understanding of the wear and failure patterns of mechanical and electrical equipment, applying the principle of pre vention being better than cure—and addressing potential issues before they escalate—by systematically organizing maintenance and repairs according to the rate of wear and expected  service life of each component. This approach helps prevent premature wear, compensates for natural degradation, minimizes or avoids failures altogether, extends equipment lifespan , and ultimately saves time spent on repairs, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and boosting economic returns. The practical implementation of planned preventive maintenance  can be summarized as  ""regular inspections, timely upkeep, and scheduled repairs, "" making it particularly suitable for Chapter 1 of this guide: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment. 11 Macro-level management. I mplementing a planned preventive maintenance system requires the following conditions: ① Determining the maintenance intervals for assemblies and key components through statistical analysis, measurements, and experimental studies, and rationally categorizing mainten ance tasks;
1.2.7 Patterns of Failure Occurrence Mechanical and electrical equipment failures exhibit two notable characteristics: first, the likelihood of failure increases as the equipment ages; second, failures occur randomly, making it difficult to predict the exact timing of any given failure. Consequently, over the equipment's lifespan, the probability of a failure can be expressed using statistical methods. The failure rate, denoted by ( \lambda(t) ), represents the conditional probability that a failure will occur within the infinitesimal time interval ( dt ), given that no failure has yet happened up to time ( t ).

Exceeding design-rated loads leads to severe failures. Environmental factors include climate, corrosive media, harmful substances, and the working object's condition; for example, higher temperatures accelerate wear and corrosion, while high humidity, corrosive agents, dust, and harsh conditions contribute to failures like corrosion and corrosive wear, though some environmental improvements can be made manually.

6) Use correctly Under normal operating conditions, mechanical equipment follows its own failure patterns; however, when operating conditions change, these failure patterns also shift accordingly. The primary operating conditions include the following: (1) Load. The primary causes of wear and fatigue failure in mechanical equipment are the wear of components and their fatigue-induced damage. Under specified operating conditions, the rate of component wear over a given period is directly proportional to the magnitude of the load applied. Meanwhile, fatigue damage to components occurs only under certain types of cyclic loading and intensifies as the load increases. Thus, both wear and fatigue are functions of the applied load. Exceeding the design-rated load levels can lead to severe failure, which is unacceptable. (2) Environment. The environment includes the effects of climate, corrosive media, and other harmful substances, as well as the condition of the working object itself. Increased temperatures accelerate wear and corrosion, while excessively high humidity and corrosive agents present in the air can lead to both corrosion and corrosive wear. Additionally, excessive dust levels in the air and harsh operating conditions often contribute to equipment failures. However, the environment is an objective factor, and in certain situations, measures can be taken manually to improve it. (3) Maintenance and Operation. Establishing a sound maintenance system and strictly adhering to technical maintenance guidelines and operational procedures are crucial for ensuring the reliable performance of mechanical equipment and extending its service life. Additionally, it is essential to provide training for personnel to enhance their skills and expertise.
(2) Time-to-failure. This refers to the fact that the probability of a failure increases as time goes on. In addition to using direct units like years, months, days, or hours, time can also be measured by the number of equipment operations, mileage, or cycles. For instance, vehicles typically use total miles driven as their unit of measurement, while gears might be measured by the number of load-bearing cycles they endure. (3) The specified conditions. These refer to the operational and maintenance conditions during equipment operation, the skill level of personnel, environmental factors, and more. Different conditions will lead to different types of failures.
By the rate at which the fault develops (1) Sudden failures. These failures occur unexpectedly and spontaneously, typically independent of the equipment’s usage time. They are often preceded by no obvious warning signs, making them difficult to predict even through early-stage testing or trials. Such failures usually result from a combination of inherent adverse factors within the process system and unpredictable external influences. (2) Gradual failure. These failures develop slowly and typically occur during the later stages of an electromechanical device's useful life. Their likelihood of occurrence is closely tied to the equipment's usage time, and they can often be predicted through early-stage testing or monitoring. Such failures usually result from the gradual progression of issues like corrosion, wear, fatigue, and material aging in the components.
(3) Late-stage failures (dissipation-phase failures). These typically occur during the latter part of a device's lifespan, often after the equipment has been in use for an extended period—or even beyond its intended service life. Such failures arise due to gradual wear, fatigue, and aging of the equipment's components, leading to a decline in system functionality. Ultimately, this can result in sudden, hazardous, and potentially widespread system breakdowns. During this phase, the failure rate of the equipment tends to increase steadily."

1.2 Basics of Equipment Maintenance 1.2.1 Maintenance Method The method of equipment maintenance carries the meaning of a maintenance strategy. Modern equipment management emphasizes applying different maintenance approaches to various types of equipment, underscoring that equipment repair should align with the objective principles governing the physical lifecycle of machinery and materials. This approach ensures production continuity while optimizing the efficient use of maintenance resources, ultimately achieving the most cost-effective outcome over the equipment's entire lifespan. Commonly used maintenance methods for electromechanical equipment include the following: Reactive Maintenance Post-failure maintenance, also known as breakdown maintenance, damage repair, or unplanned maintenance, refers to repairs carried out after mechanical and electrical equipment has malfunctioned—essentially, ""if it breaks, we fix it."" For certain critical equipment, post-failure maintenance should be minimized whenever possible; however, for devices that have minimal impact on production or are backed up by redundant units, opting for post-failure maintenance is often the most cost-effective approach. Preventive Maintenance Maintenance performed before mechanical and electrical equipment fails is called preventive maintenance. Its main benefits include reducing unexpected equipment failures, ensuring continuous production, integrating equipment upkeep and repair tasks into a structured plan—thereby minimizing unplanned disruptions in production—and ultimately improving equipment utilization, lowering maintenance costs, and extending the equipment's natural lifespan. Preventive maintenance is categorized into two basic forms: Regular maintenance Regular maintenance is also known as planned maintenance or time-based preventive maintenance. It involves carrying out preventive maintenance activities at predetermined intervals and follows a cyclical pattern. This type of maintenance is based on the wear patterns of components, with specific guidelines for setting maintenance intervals, defining maintenance categories, outlining maintenance tasks, and estimating the associated workload. However, this approach to maintenance can lead to certain challenges: First, when equipment is still in good technical condition and fully capable of continuing operation, it may undergo major over-maintenance simply because the scheduled interval has arrived—resulting in unnecessary repairs. Second, if a machine’s technical condition has already deteriorated to the point where it can no longer meet production requirements, but the prescribed maintenance interval hasn’t yet been reached, no repair plan will be implemented, leading to under-maintenance. This method is particularly well-suited for process-oriented production equipment or power systems where the wear patterns are well understood, and operations are stable and continuous—such as large-scale assembly line equipment or key machinery operating on automated production lines. Currently, China primarily implements two main types of equipment maintenance systems: the Planned Preventive Maintenance System and the Planned Warranty System. (1) Planned Preventive Maintenance System (referred to as Planned Pre-Maintenance). This system involves maintaining, inspecting, and repairing equipment according to its wear patterns, adhering to predetermined maintenance cycles and procedures, to ensure that the equipment consistently remains in optimal technical condition. Its key features are outlined below. ① Perform daily cleaning, inspection, lubrication, tightening, and adjustments on equipment as required to minimize wear and ensure proper operation. ② Conduct regular inspections and adjustments of the equipment's operational status and wear levels according to the prescribed schedule, ensuring that potential issues are promptly addressed. This allows you to monitor changes in the equipment's technical condition and adequately prepare the necessary resources for scheduled maintenance. ③ Conduct preventive maintenance on equipment in a planned and prepared manner. (2) The Planned Maintenance System (also known as the Maintenance and Repair System) is a equipment maintenance approach that combines routine upkeep with scheduled inspections and repairs. Its key features are outlined below. ① Based on the equipment's characteristics and condition, different maintenance categories and intervals are specified according to operational hours (such as production output and mileage).
Due to various reasons, the early failure period may reappear after major equipment repairs or upgrades. 2. Random Failure Period During the random failure period, the failure rate remains low and stable, nearly constant. Random failures are caused by偶然因素—they are unpredictable and cannot be eliminated even by extending the running-in phase. Design flaws, component defects, inadequate maintenance, and improper operation can all lead to random failures. 3. Wear-Out Failure Phase The characteristic of wear-out failures is that the failure rate increases as operating time accumulates. Wear-out failures are caused by factors such as wear fatigue, aging, and corrosion of equipment components. These types of failures typically indicate that the equipment is approaching its major overhaul period or nearing the end of its service life. 1.3 Failure Modes of Mechanical Components and Corresponding Countermeasures During equipment operation, the phenomenon where mechanical components lose their intended functionality due to various factors such as design, materials, manufacturing processes, and assembly—rendering them unable to continue working—is referred to as failure. When critical components of machinery fail, it indicates that the equipment has entered a state of malfunction. Machine failures are inherently linked to the failure of mechanical parts. Given the wide variety of mechanical equipment types, along with significant differences in operating conditions and environmental factors, the failure modes of mechanical components also vary widely. Among these, the four most common and representative failure modes are wear, corrosion, deformation, and fracture. 1.3.1 Wear of Mechanical Components Wear of mechanical components is the primary failure mode for parts. In typical mechanical equipment, approximately 80% of failed or scrapped components are due to wear-related issues. Wear not only reduces the efficiency and reliability of机电设备 but can also lead to premature failure of the equipment itself. Therefore, conducting research into the wear mechanisms of机电设备 can help us understand the specific wear characteristics of various components, providing a solid foundation for developing effective maintenance strategies and schedules—and ultimately extending the service life of the equipment. 1. General Patterns of Part Wear Wear is a microscopic and dynamic process that occurs as parts wear down. Various physical, chemical, and mechanical phenomena occur, along with their external manifestations. The state refers to the wear of the surface material, and the extent of wear is typically measured by abrasion. Measure, measure. Under normal operating conditions, the wear process of the part is divided into 3 stages. Phase, as shown in Figure 1.3, where w represents the wear amount. 1) Fitting-in Phase OA It occurs during the initial phase of equipment use. At this stage, the surfaces of the friction pair exhibit micro-… Observing the wave peaks results in a smaller actual contact area between the parts, leading to increased contact stress. Very large, resulting in plastic deformation and wear at the surface of the running parts at a rapid rate.
2) Fatigue Crack Propagation Zone This region is the most critical feature area on the fracture surface, often appearing shell-like or resembling beach ripples. Each individual line marks the trace left behind after a single crack extension event—typically corresponding to a change in applied load, such as when a machine starts up or shuts down. These lines radiate outward from the fatigue core, advancing perpendicularly to the direction of crack propagation. The smoother the crack propagation zone on the fatigue fracture surface, the more load cycles the component endured prior to failure. Conversely, the denser the shell-like lines near the instantaneous fracture zone indicate lower load magnitudes. On the other hand, if this area appears rougher, it suggests that the crack propagated rapidly under relatively high loading conditions. 3) Transient Break Zone Commonly referred to as the ""static fracture surface,"" it is the fracture region formed when a fatigue crack rapidly propagates upon reaching a critical size. Its macroscopic features closely resemble the radial zone and shear lips typically observed in fast-fracture areas of static tensile fractures. The location and size of the instantaneous fracture zone are directly influenced by the applied load—specifically, the greater the load, the closer the final fracture area moves toward the center of the fracture surface. Conversely, a smaller fracture area indicates that the component was subjected to a lower load. 3. Fracture Failure Analysis"

1.1.1 Meaning of the Failure Typically, a failure is defined as a condition in which a device (system) or component has lost its specified functionality. From a systems perspective, failure carries two key meanings: first, it refers to the mechanical system deviating from its normal function. The primary cause of this deviation lies in Chapter 1—Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Electromechanical Equipment. 3 Work conditions (including components) are abnormal, and these types of failures can be resolved by adjusting parameters or repairing the affected parts, allowing the system to return to normal operation. The second scenario is functional failure, where the system continuously deviates from its intended performance, with the degree of deviation steadily worsening—eventually rendering the equipment unable to perform its basic functions. Such situations are classified as failures. Typically, failed individual components can be replaced; however, if critical components fail, it often results in the complete loss of the machine’s functionality. The primary goal of failure analysis is to identify failure modes, uncover underlying failure mechanisms, and develop strategies to minimize failures, ultimately enhancing the reliability and effective utilization of electromechanical equipment. For the fault, the following points should be clarified:

3. Reliability Maintenance Also known as Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM), this approach emerged in the U.S. civil aviation industry during the 1960s and is now widely implemented in industries with particularly high demands for equipment operational reliability, such as the nuclear and military sectors. While the time it takes for a potential failure in operating equipment to evolve into a functional failure can vary, all failure patterns eventually reveal detectable trends through systematic monitoring. This technique leverages these predictable patterns to implement proactive maintenance measures—making it a reliability-focused maintenance strategy aimed at enhancing equipment dependability. Rooted in reliability theory, RCM involves detailed analysis and experimentation of factors influencing system reliability, followed by the application of logical decision-making processes. This approach enables the scientific development of tailored maintenance plans, the optimal selection of repair methods, and the precise determination of equipment lifespan—all designed to maintain and restore the inherent reliability of assets while minimizing costs. Reliability-based maintenance is advancing equipment repair work toward greater scientific rigor and modernization, making it worthy of further attention and research. 4. Quality Maintenance This is an equipment maintenance procedure developed with a focus on ensuring product quality, aiming to keep all critical quality characteristics of product components and parts in optimal condition. To achieve this goal, the method manages key factors influencing quality—such as people, machines, and materials—and places particular emphasis on the relationship between equipment performance and product quality. It employs tools from Total Quality Management, including graphical techniques like Pareto charts, as well as statistical analysis methods. By closely monitoring product quality conditions, the process identifies problematic production steps, pinpointing faulty equipment areas and their root causes, and then systematically categorizes and organizes this information. Based on the severity of each issue, critical problems are prioritized, analyzed one by one, and targeted recovery measures are formulated. For chronic quality issues where the root cause remains unclear, PM analysis (Process-Machine Phenomenon Analysis) is utilized to investigate further. Perform a root cause analysis to identify the reasons and solutions, and establish a management system to prevent future failures.
1.2.4 Use of Mechanical and Elect rical Equipment During operation, equipment's technical condition changes—and its performance gradually declines—due to various forces acting upon it, as well as factors such as en vironmental conditions, usage methods, operational guidelines, and the duration of use. To effectively manage these changes in technical condition and slow down the decline in equi pment performance, the most critical measure is to ensure the equipment is used properly and correctly. Maintenance of mechanical and electrical equipment is a crucial method for i mproving utilization and ensuring its functionality—it consists of two forms: daily maintenance and periodic maintenance. Daily maintenance is primarily carried out by operators of  mechanical and electrical equipment—conducting pre-shift inspections and post-shift cleaning to ensure that the equipment remains in optimal technical condition. Regular maintenan ce, also known as Level 1 care, is carried out by operators with assistance from maintenance personnel. It’s similar to minor repairs and is covered in Chapter 1 of the  ""Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance. "" 13
4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃ 3Fe + 2O₂ → Fe₃O₄ Corrosion products such as Fe₂O₃ or Fe₃O₄ typically form a protective film that coats the metal surface. During friction, Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment 21 After the surface oxide film is worn away, the friction surface quickly reacts with the oxidizing medium, forming a new oxide layer that is subsequently removed during the friction  process. This cyclical process ultimately leads to metal corrosion. A key characteristic of oxidative wear is the presence of uniform, fine grooves aligned along the sliding direc tion on the friction surface, accompanied by reddish-brown flaky Fe₂O₃ or grayish-black filamentous Fe₃O₄ debris. Debris is generated. The primary factors influencing oxidative wea r are the density and integrity of the oxide film, as well as how firmly it adheres to the substrate. If the oxide film is dense, intact, free of pores, and strongly bonded to the  metal substrate, it exhibits excellent wear resistance, resists being worn away easily, and effectively helps prevent corrosion of the metal surface. 2. Electrochemical Corrosion o f Metal Parts Electrochemical corrosion is a complex physical and chemical process of corrosion. It can be defined as the continuous, charge-driven chemical corrosion that occurs w hen two metal electrodes with a potential difference are immersed in an electrolyte solution. This type of corrosion happens when metals come into contact with electrolytic substan ces, and its key distinction from ordinary chemical corrosion lies in the fact that it involves the flow of electric current during the process. The fundamental conditions necessar y for electrochemical corrosion to occur are: ① the presence of two or more objects with differing electrode potentials—or, within a single object, regions exhibiting different ele ctrode potentials—that act as positive and negative electrodes; ② a conductive pathway connecting the electrodes, either through a conductor or direct contact, allowing charges in  the corrosion zone to flow freely; and ③ the simultaneous presence of an electrolyte solution. Common forms of electrochemical corrosion include the following: (1) Uniform corrosio n. When a metal part or component exhibits a uniform corrosion pattern across its surface, it is referred to as uniform corrosion. This type of corrosion can occur in liquids, the  atmosphere, or soil. Among mechanical equipment, the most common form of uniform corrosion is atmospheric corrosion. In industrial areas, the atmosphere often contains higher conce ntrations of corrosive gases such as CO₂, SO₂, H₂S, NO₂, and Cl₂. Additionally, airborne dust particles may carry acidic, alkaline, or saline micro-particles, which, when adhering  to the surface of components, can absorb moisture from the air and form an electrolyte, ultimately leading to corrosion on the part's surface. (2) Pitting corrosion. On most surfac es of metal components, corrosion either doesn’t occur at all or is very mild; however, localized areas develop small corrosion pits that penetrate deeply into the material. This t ype of corrosion is known as pitting corrosion. Because metals used in industry often contain extremely tiny microelectrodes, they are highly susceptible to pitting corrosion when  exposed to aqueous solutions or humid environments. In the case of steel components, when pitting corrosion occurs alongside uniform corrosion, the corrosion spots can easily becom e obscured by the porous structure formed during uniform corrosion, making them difficult to detect and identify. As a result, pitting corrosion is one of the most dangerous forms  of corrosion. (3) Crevice corrosion. In机电 equipment, gaps exist between various connected components—typically ranging from 0.025 to 0.1 mm. When corrosive media enter these gaps a nd remain trapped, localized corrosion can occur precisely at the crevices. For instance, this type of crevice corrosion often happens at flange faces where pipes are connected, as  well as at the riveted joints of metal rivets. (4) Corrosion Fatigue. When metallic components subjected to cyclic stress experience reduced fatigue strength or shortened fatigue  life—and ultimately fail—due to the presence of a corrosive environment, this phenomenon is known as corrosion fatigue or corrosion fatigue fracture. Corrosion fatigue can cause me tal components to fracture even under very low levels of cyclic (pulsating) stress, and often there is no clear fatigue limit. As a result, damage caused by corrosion fatigue tends  to be more severe than that resulting from pure mechanical fatigue alone. To prevent and reduce corrosion failures, as well as minimize their harmful effects on equipment, special  attention must be paid during the manufacturing process to correctly selecting materials for components and thoughtfully designing various structural elements. Additionally, for p arts operating in corrosive environments, advanced anti-corrosion measures such as surface coating technologies, electrochemical protection techniques, and the addition of corrosio n inhibitors should be employed to ensure that these components remain protected—or at least minimally affected—by corrosive agents."

Context:  
Condition-Based Maintenance System It is based on reliability theory, condition monitoring, and fault diagnosis, determining the timing and scope of maintenance based on actual technical condition assessments of mechanical and electrical equipment. Given that many complex mechanical and electrical systems typically experience only early or occasional failures—without a wear-out phase—regular, scheduled maintenance often proves ineffective against such faults. Moreover, in modern mechanical and electrical systems, only a small number of component failures pose safety risks; thus, maintenance tasks should be tailored specifically to the functional requirements of each part, considering potential functional failures, their root causes, and their consequences. This maintenance approach is characterized by flexible decision-making regarding maintenance cycles, procedures, and scopes—adapting dynamically to the actual conditions of the equipment. It shifts the focus of maintenance activities from routine repairs and upkeep to proactive inspections, underpinned by the implementation of a systematic inspection system. Not only does this inspection process provide critical information for determining optimal maintenance timing and scope, but it also allows certain maintenance tasks to be carried out incrementally and efficiently. By conducting daily, periodic, and precision inspections of mechanical and electrical equipment, combined with thorough analysis of condition-monitoring and fault-diagnosis data, operators can accurately assess the degree of degradation and proactively address issues before they escalate into full-blown failures. This approach ensures that equipment remains reliably operational while maximizing the lifespan of its components—making it far more efficient and cost-effective than traditional planned preventive maintenance strategies. To successfully implement condition-based maintenance, several prerequisites must be met: robust reliability testing data and comprehensive documentation are essential for effectively managing the mechanical and electrical systems. 2) Condition Monitoring and Maintenance This is a preventive maintenance approach based on the equipment's technical condition, carried out precisely when needed.

6 The procedure for equipment failure management is outlined below. (1) Conduct thorough education and awareness campaigns to ensure that operators and maintenance personnel voluntarily comply with relevant rules and regulations regarding operation, maintenance, inspection, etc., properly use and carefully maintain equipment, and diligently record, compile statistics, and analyze any equipment malfunctions. (2) Based on the company’s actual production conditions, equipment status, and specific features, determine the key areas for equipment failure management. (3) Use monitoring instruments and diagnostic techniques to systematically monitor critical equipment, enabling timely detection of fault indicators and deterioration. Information on equipment condition. Typically, equipment can undergo daily inspections, routine patrols, and periodic checks (including precision assessments), as well as integrity assessments—using human senses and common diagnostic tools—to closely monitor the technical status and any unusual signs in components, mechanisms, and areas prone to failure. At the same time, inspection standards should be established to clearly define the boundaries between normal operation, abnormalities, and equipment failures. (4) To quickly locate the fault location and its cause, in addition to providing training to ensure that maintenance and operational staff acquire a solid understanding of electrical and hydraulic technologies, it is also essential to compile common equipment failure symptoms, analysis procedures, and troubleshooting methods into a fault-finding logic flowchart.

The material condition and characteristics. 1.1.3 Characteristics of the Failure Diversity Various pieces of equipment not only differ in structure and process parameters, but also vary in their manufacturing, installation processes, and operating environments—leading to a wide range of potential failures during operation. Hierarchical Structure Once a device exhibits a certain failure symptom, it becomes necessary to investigate the root cause of the malfunction. However, some failure causes are often deeply rooted—meaning that a higher-level failure stems from a lower-level one, creating a hierarchical pattern. Multifactorial and Correlation The components of the equipment—and even individual devices—are interconnected through mechanical structures or material transfer. If one component or device fails, it can trigger malfunctions in other components or devices as well, highlighting the multifactorial and interconnected nature of failures. Therefore, when diagnosing the root cause of a malfunction, it’s essential to thoroughly consider all relevant factors involved. Delayed Response During operation, equipment components are continuously subjected to factors such as impact, stress, friction, wear, and corrosion, leading to vibrations, displacements, deformations, fatigue, and crack propagation. These processes gradually degrade the equipment's condition—until, at a certain point, the degradation becomes severe enough to result in mechanical malfunctions or even complete loss of functionality. The time-lag inherent in this failure progression underscores the importance of identifying potential issues early on and implementing preventive measures promptly, thereby minimizing the damage that could arise when a failure ultimately occurs. Uncertainty (Ambiguity) A single fault phenomenon can arise from multiple underlying causes; conversely, a single cause may manifest in various fault symptoms. The occurrence of faults, their specific manifestations, quantitative descriptions, and detection analyses all involve inherent uncertainties, thereby complicating the tasks of fault diagnosis and repair.

1.2 Basics of Equipment Maintenance 1.2.1 Maintenance Method The method of equipment maintenance carries the meaning of a maintenance strategy. Modern equipment management emphasizes applying different maintenance approaches to various types of equipment, underscoring that equipment repair should align with the objective principles governing the physical lifecycle of machinery and materials. This approach ensures production continuity while optimizing the efficient use of maintenance resources, ultimately achieving the most cost-effective outcome over the equipment's entire lifespan. Commonly used maintenance methods for electromechanical equipment include the following: Reactive Maintenance Post-failure maintenance, also known as breakdown maintenance, damage repair, or unplanned maintenance, refers to repairs carried out after mechanical and electrical equipment has malfunctioned—essentially, ""if it breaks, we fix it."" For certain critical equipment, post-failure maintenance should be minimized whenever possible; however, for devices that have minimal impact on production or are backed up by redundant units, opting for post-failure maintenance is often the most cost-effective approach. Preventive Maintenance Maintenance performed before mechanical and electrical equipment fails is called preventive maintenance. Its main benefits include reducing unexpected equipment failures, ensuring continuous production, integrating equipment upkeep and repair tasks into a structured plan—thereby minimizing unplanned disruptions in production—and ultimately improving equipment utilization, lowering maintenance costs, and extending the equipment's natural lifespan. Preventive maintenance is categorized into two basic forms: Regular maintenance Regular maintenance is also known as planned maintenance or time-based preventive maintenance. It involves carrying out preventive maintenance activities at predetermined intervals and follows a cyclical pattern. This type of maintenance is based on the wear patterns of components, with specific guidelines for setting maintenance intervals, defining maintenance categories, outlining maintenance tasks, and estimating the associated workload. However, this approach to maintenance can lead to certain challenges: First, when equipment is still in good technical condition and fully capable of continuing operation, it may undergo major over-maintenance simply because the scheduled interval has arrived—resulting in unnecessary repairs. Second, if a machine’s technical condition has already deteriorated to the point where it can no longer meet production requirements, but the prescribed maintenance interval hasn’t yet been reached, no repair plan will be implemented, leading to under-maintenance. This method is particularly well-suited for process-oriented production equipment or power systems where the wear patterns are well understood, and operations are stable and contin uous—such as large-scale assembly line equipment or key machinery operating on automated production lines. Currently, China primarily implements two main types of equipment mainten ance systems: the Planned Preventive Maintenance System and the Planned Warranty System. (1) Planned Preventive Maintenance System (referred to as Planned Pre-Maintenance). This sy stem involves maintaining, inspecting, and repairing equipment according to its wear patterns, adhering to predetermined maintenance cycles and procedures, to ensure that the equip ment consistently remains in optimal technical condition. Its key features are outlined below. ① Perform daily cleaning, inspection, lubrication, tightening, and adjustments on equ ipment as required to minimize wear and ensure proper operation. ② Conduct regular inspections and adjustments of the equipment's operational status and wear levels according to th e prescribed schedule, ensuring that potential issues are promptly addressed. This allows you to monitor changes in the equipment's technical condition and adequately prepare the n ecessary resources for scheduled maintenance. ③ Conduct preventive maintenance on equipment in a planned and prepared manner. (2) The Planned Maintenance System (also known as the  Maintenance and Repair System) is a equipment maintenance approach that combines routine upkeep with scheduled inspections and repairs. Its key features are outlined below. ① Based  on the equipment's characteristics and condition, different maintenance categories and intervals are specified according to operational hours (such as production output and mileag e).
(2) Read the equipment manual and equipment catalog. (3) Survey equipment operators and maintenance personnel: Identify parts of the equipment that are prone to failures during operation and the underlying causes; assess the equipment’s precision and overall performance; highlight the major existing defects; and gather specific recommendations for repairs and improvements required during major overhauls. (4) Solicit input from departments such as Technology, Quality, and Production Management regarding localized equipment improvements. Pre-screening (1) The purpose of the pre-inspection. Through pre-inspection, we can comprehensively and thoroughly assess the deterioration of equipment conditions, gain a clearer understanding of how product processes affect the equipment’s precision and performance, thereby identifying which parts need to be replaced or repaired. This information then allows us to create detailed drawings or verify existing ones for these parts, ensuring they meet the requirements for manufacturing and repair work. (2) Pre-inspection content: Typically, the pre-inspection content is determined based on the equipment type and the pre-repair investigation. (3) Inspect geometric and operational accuracy item by item, according to the equipment manufacturer's precision standards and inspection methods for each country or enterprise.

Material details, etc. 6. Maintenance-Free Design Maintenance-free design is the ideal goal for equipment maintenance—it refers to implementing improvement measures during the design phase of new machinery and electrical equipment to address common failures encountered during maintenance, aiming to minimize maintenance efforts or even eliminate the need for repairs altogether. 1.2.2 Maintenance Method Selection The purpose of maintenance is to ensure the reliable operation of equipment—specifically, to guarantee the dependable fulfillment of its intended use—and, at the same time, minimize maintenance costs. Therefore, the fundamental requirements for maintenance decisions are: ① Reliability must not fall below the permissible minimum value [R], meaning that ()[] R ≥ R(t); ② Maintenance costs (KI) must be kept as low as possible—or, alternatively, must not exceed a predetermined maintenance cost limit (KImin), i.e., K ≤ KImin. To optimize maintenance decisions, the first step should be to choose an appropriate maintenance approach. The six maintenance methods mentioned above each have a specific scope of applicability; however, their effectiveness can vary depending on how appropriately they are applied. To maximize equipment efficiency, minimize downtime-related losses, and reduce maintenance costs, it’s essential to select the most suitable approach based on the characteristics of mechatronic systems and the conditions under which they are used. Looking ahead, the trend in maintenance practices is shifting from routine preventive maintenance toward planned, periodic inspections—and then, based on inspection findings, scheduling timely condition-based repairs. As the technological sophistication of factory equipment continues to rise, with increasingly complex system designs and broader adoption of mechatronic solutions, production activities are becoming more reliant on equipment performance and reliability. Consequently, the traditional static approach to maintenance management is evolving into a more dynamic model, gradually moving toward advanced strategies such as reliability-centered maintenance and quality-focused repair practices. Mechatronic equipment comes in a wide variety of types and is widely applied, making it essential to select one or a combination of maintenance methods tailored to the specific situation. When choosing a maintenance approach for mechatronic systems, reliability typically becomes the primary focus. For critical components, implementing condition-based monitoring allows for timely preventive measures. Meanwhile, for equipment at quality control points, it’s crucial to closely track changes in product quality during the manufacturing process and promptly address any detected anomalies through quality repairs. Additionally, it’s important to equip teams with personnel who are well-versed in microelectronics technology, providing them with supervision and guidance while fostering the development of skilled, integrated mechatronics technicians. Regular inspections and logical fault analysis should be conducted on CNC and other mechatronic systems, and any failed components identified must be promptly replaced and properly adjusted to ensure optimal performance. 1.2.3 Maintenance System Maintenance work is not only a technical task but also a managerial one. A maintenance system refers to a set of guidelines established under specific maintenance theories and principles, encompassing elements such as maintenance plans, categories, methods, timing, scope, levels, organizational structures, and performance evaluation metrics. Implementing a rational maintenance system helps optimize the allocation of human, material, and financial resources, enabling timely preparation before maintenance tasks, ensuring repairs are carried out appropriately, meeting operational requirements, enhancing the technical condition, reliability, and service life of机电 equipment, reducing downtime, and minimizing maintenance costs and production losses due to equipment shutdowns. Meanwhile, maintenance systems are continuously evolving and improving—currently, the main approaches include the following: Planned Preventive Maintenance System It is based on a thorough understanding of the wear and failure patterns of mechanical and electrical equipment, applying the principle of pre vention being better than cure—and addressing potential issues before they escalate—by systematically organizing maintenance and repairs according to the rate of wear and expected  service life of each component. This approach helps prevent premature wear, compensates for natural degradation, minimizes or avoids failures altogether, extends equipment lifespan , and ultimately saves time spent on repairs, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and boosting economic returns. The practical implementation of planned preventive maintenance  can be summarized as  ""regular inspections, timely upkeep, and scheduled repairs, "" making it particularly suitable for Chapter 1 of this guide: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment. 11 Macro-level management. I mplementing a planned preventive maintenance system requires the following conditions: ① Determining the maintenance intervals for assemblies and key components through statistical analysis, measurements, and experimental studies, and rationally categorizing mainten ance tasks;
1.2 Basics of Equipment Maintenance 1.2.1 Maintenance Method The method of equipment maintenance carries the meaning of a maintenance strategy. Modern equipment management emphasizes applying different maintenance approaches to various types of equipment, underscoring that equipment repair should align with the objective principles governing the physical lifecycle of machinery and materials. This approach ensures production continuity while optimizing the efficient use of maintenance resources, ultimately achieving the most cost-effective outcome over the equipment's entire lifespan. Commonly used maintenance methods for electromechanical equipment include the following: Reactive Maintenance Post-failure maintenance, also known as breakdown maintenance, damage repair, or unplanned maintenance, refers to repairs carried out after mechanical and electrical equipment has malfunctioned—essentially, ""if it breaks, we fix it."" For certain critical equipment, post-failure maintenance should be minimized whenever possible; however, for devices that have minimal impact on production or are backed up by redundant units, opting for post-failure maintenance is often the most cost-effective approach. Preventive Maintenance Maintenance performed before mechanical and electrical equipment fails is called preventive maintenance. Its main benefits include reducing unexpected equipment failures, ensuring continuous production, integrating equipment upkeep and repair tasks into a structured plan—thereby minimizing unplanned disruptions in production—and ultimately improving equipment utilization, lowering maintenance costs, and extending the equipment's natural lifespan. Preventive maintenance is categorized into two basic forms: Regular maintenance Regular maintenance is also known as planned maintenance or time-based preventive maintenance. It involves carrying out preventive maintenance activities at predetermined intervals and follows a cyclical pattern. This type of maintenance is based on the wear patterns of components, with specific guidelines for setting maintenance intervals, defining maintenance categories, outlining maintenance tasks, and estimating the associated workload. However, this approach to maintenance can lead to certain challenges: First, when equipment is still in good technical condition and fully capable of continuing operation, it may undergo major over-maintenance simply because the scheduled interval has arrived—resulting in unnecessary repairs. Second, if a machine’s technical condition has already deteriorated to the point where it can no longer meet production requirements, but the prescribed maintenance interval hasn’t yet been reached, no repair plan will be implemented, leading to under-maintenance. This method is particularly well-suited for process-oriented production equipment or power systems where the wear patterns are well understood, and operations are stable and contin uous—such as large-scale assembly line equipment or key machinery operating on automated production lines. Currently, China primarily implements two main types of equipment mainten ance systems: the Planned Preventive Maintenance System and the Planned Warranty System. (1) Planned Preventive Maintenance System (referred to as Planned Pre-Maintenance).

Its key features are outlined below. ① Perform daily cleaning, inspection, lubrication, tightening, and adjustments on equ ipment as required to minimize wear and ensure proper operation. ② Conduct regular inspections and adjustments of the equipment's operational status and wear levels according to th e prescribed schedule, ensuring that potential issues are promptly addressed. This allows you to monitor changes in the equipment's technical condition and adequately prepare the n ecessary resources for scheduled maintenance. ③ Conduct preventive maintenance on equipment in a planned and prepared manner. (2) The Planned Maintenance System (also known as the  Maintenance and Repair System) is a equipment maintenance approach that combines routine upkeep with scheduled inspections and repairs. Its key features are outlined below. ① Based  on the equipment's characteristics and condition, different maintenance categories and intervals are specified according to operational hours (such as production output and mileag e).
Condition-Based Maintenance System It is based on reliability theory, condition monitoring, and fault diagnosis, determining the timing and scope of maintenance based on actual technical condition assessments of mechanical and electrical equipment. Given that many complex mechanical and electrical systems typically experience only early or occasional failures—without a wear-out phase—regular, scheduled maintenance often proves ineffective against such faults. Moreover, in modern mechanical and electrical systems, only a small number of component failures pose safety risks; thus, maintenance tasks should be tailored specifically to the functional requirements of each part, considering potential functional failures, their root causes, and their consequences. This maintenance approach is characterized by flexible decision-making regarding maintenance cycles, procedures, and scopes—adapting dynamically to the actual conditions of the equipment. It shifts the focus of maintenance activities from routine repairs and upkeep to proactive inspections, underpinned by the implementation of a systematic inspection system. Not only does this inspection process provide critical information for determining optimal maintenance timing and scope, but it also allows certain maintenance tasks to be carried out incrementally and efficiently. By conducting daily, periodic, and precision inspections of mechanical and electrical equipment, combined with thorough analysis of condition-monitoring and fault-diagnosis data, operators can accurately assess the degree of degradation and proactively address issues before they escalate into full-blown failures. This approach ensures that equipment remains reliably operational while maximizing the lifespan of its components—making it far more efficient and cost-effective than traditional planned preventive maintenance strategies. To successfully implement condition-based maintenance, several prerequisites must be met: robust reliability testing data and comprehensive documentation are essential for effectively managing the mechanical and electrical systems.

③ Having well-equipped maintenance facilities organized according to functional divisions and strategically located for optimal efficiency. The main drawback of the planned preven tive maintenance system is its poor cost-effectiveness. With fixed maintenance cycles and scopes, it often leads to unnecessary repairs of certain components—what’s known as over-m aintenance. During the maintenance process, repairs are categorized into several levels and types based on the depth and breadth of the work required, including major overhauls, mi d-level repairs, minor repairs, item-specific repairs, retrofits, and unplanned maintenance tasks—all determined by the scale and nature of the repair workload. (1) Overhaul: A com prehensive or fundamental restoration of the functionality of mechanical and electrical equipment, typically carried out by specialized maintenance teams within factories and mines —or at repair centers established in regions with a high concentration of industrial facilities. During an overhaul, the equipment is either fully or extensively disassembled, with  a focus on repairing critical components, replacing or refurbishing parts that have lost their function or are on the verge of doing so. After the repairs, the equipment’s precisi on is restored to nearly its original factory specifications, while also receiving a fresh cosmetic overhaul to enhance its appearance. (2) Intermediate Overhaul. This is a level o f maintenance that falls between major and minor overhauls, serving as a balanced approach to upkeep. (3) Minor Repair. This involves replacing or repairing components that have si gnificantly worn out or are nearing failure within the maintenance interval, without addressing any underlying structural issues. It is a troubleshooting-based repair aimed at rest oring functionality. The three levels—major overhaul, mid-term repair, and minor repair—objectively reflect the chronological progression of机电 equipment, making them ideally suited  for implementing time-based planned preventive maintenance, a practice widely adopted by most organizations. However, these levels still require complementary repair tiers to addr ess unforeseen maintenance needs effectively. (4) Item-based maintenance. Based on condition monitoring of mechanical and electrical equipment, this involves proactively planning r epairs specifically for components or technical items that are about to fail. Item-based maintenance is conducted between major, medium, and minor overhauls—it’s a non-periodic, pl anned maintenance level that doesn’t follow a fixed cycle. (5) Retrofitting. This involves making localized modifications to existing mechanical and electrical equipment using new  technologies, materials, structures, and processes, with the goal of enhancing its precision, functionality, productivity, and reliability. Such repairs are classified as improveme nt-oriented, and the extent of the work required depends on how well the original equipment’s design accommodates the retrofitting process—as well as on the specific level of perfo rmance enhancement desired for the equipment. Retrofitting is also referred to as modernization or upgrading. (6) Unscheduled Maintenance. This is a level of maintenance required f or mechanical and electrical equipment due to sudden breakdowns and accidents. The fewer the number and scope of unscheduled maintenance activities, the higher the level of managem ent.
12 As a basis for determining equipment condition; it requires close collaboration between the design, manufacturing, and maintenance departments to develop a comprehensive maintenance plan for mechanical and electrical equipment, along with access to necessary testing methods and standards. 3. Targeted Maintenance System This maintenance system is based on comprehensive management principles and reliability-centered maintenance thinking, adopting a practical approach tailored to the specific characteristics of mechanical and electrical equipment—such as their design, performance, and operating conditions. Building upon the implementation of a condition-based inspection system, it strategically incorporates various maintenance methods, including predictive maintenance, preventive maintenance, and corrective maintenance. By leveraging advanced decision-making tools, computer technologies, as well as state monitoring and fault diagnosis techniques, the system ensures that maintenance activities are conducted in a scientifically sound manner. Ultimately, this approach aims to minimize the total lifecycle costs of equipment while maximizing overall operational efficiency and profitability. The characteristics of the targeted maintenance system are as follows: (1) It adopts and refines the classification management approach, strengthening maintenance management for key mechanical and electrical equipment as well as critical areas. Moreov er, it implements tailored maintenance strategies based on the specific characteristics and current condition of each asset, maximizing their respective suitability and effectivene ss to achieve optimal maintenance outcomes. (2) Among various maintenance approaches, condition monitoring and predictive maintenance should be promoted as the primary methods. Imp lement a systematic inspection system that embodies reliability-centered thinking, focusing maintenance efforts on routine upkeep while striving for targeted, proactive interventio ns whenever possible. (3) Emphasize the role of information, leverage computer technology for dynamic management, and make timely decisions to ensure that maintenance efforts are t ruly targeted and effective. The content of the targeted maintenance system includes: ① implementing a periodic inspection system, categorizing mechanical and electrical equipment,  and applying various maintenance methods in a targeted manner; ② enhancing planned preventive maintenance by adopting maintenance type decisions for equipment equipped with condit ion-monitoring systems, allowing for tailored corrective or major overhauls; ③ establishing a set of maintenance and inspection standards, along with standardized work-hour quotas;  ④ introducing computer-aided dynamic management, including decision-support systems for all relevant processes. 4. Operation and Maintenance System This is a standardized requirem ent for personnel behavior, serving as an essential software engineering practice in机电 equipment management, and it primarily consists of five disciplines and four key requirements . Five disciplines: ① Implement operator-specific machine assignments; ② Maintain cleanliness of mechanical and electrical equipment, ensuring proper lubrication and maintenance; ③ Follow safety operating procedures and the shift handover system; ④ Properly manage tools and accessories; ⑤ Immediately stop and inspect the machine upon detecting any malfunction. Four requirements: ① Neatness; ② Cleanliness; ③ Lubrication; ④ Safety."

2) Condition Monitoring and Maintenance This is a preventive maintenance approach based on the equipment's technical condition, carried out precisely when needed. It relies on condition monitoring and advanced diagnostic techniques to track the gradual deterioration of equipment over time.  By leveraging highly predictive insights, this method allows for timely scheduling of preventive maintenance activities, which is why it’s also referred to as  ""predictive maintenance. "" At its core, this maintenance strategy integrates comprehensive data from various sources—such as inspections, routine upkeep, operational use, and repair activities—especially insights gained from diagnostics and monitoring. Through rigorous statistical analysis, it accurately assesses the extent of equipment degradation, identifies specific areas where failures may occur (or are likely to occur), and predicts trends in the equipment’s overall technical condition. Armed with this information, operators can then determine the most appropriate type of maintenance intervention. By doing so, organizations gain full control over maintenance activities, ensuring thorough preparation before repairs begin. Moreover, this approach enables seamless coordination with production schedules, maximizing equipment utilization while simultaneously extending the lifespan of critical components. However, this method does come with some drawbacks: it tends to be more expensive and requires sophisticated diagnostic capabilities. Additionally, it demands highly skilled technicians who can interpret complex data and make informed decisions. This approach is particularly well-suited for critical, high-value equipment, key assets on production lines, machinery that cannot be easily disassembled for inspection (such as precision machine tools), and systems whose failure could lead to significant environmental or public health concerns.

1.5.1 The Significance of Equipment Management Strengthening equipment management and ensuring proper maintenance will keep machinery consistently in excellent condition, thereby extending its lifespan. This not only plays a critical role in boosting production volume and variety, enhancing labor productivity, reducing consumption, lowering costs, and safeguarding worker safety—but also significantly contributes to upgrading the company’s overall production technology, accelerating industrial growth, and protecting productive capacity. Equipment management is an extremely important task—only by effectively managing equipment can organizations achieve optimal economic results with minimal human, financial, and material resources. This, in turn, allows for the full realization of equipment potential, enabling businesses to better meet production goals. Especially in modern manufacturing, prioritizing sound equipment management is a fundamental principle that must be followed. Equipment maintenance management is an important component of enterprise management. Its primary tasks include: maximizing Effectively collecting and utilizing equipment information resources allows for the strategic management of manpower, materials, funds, equipment, and technology within the maintenance system, ensuring that maintenance operations achieve optimal quality and maximum efficiency. The key components of maintenance management include maintenance information management, maintenance planning, maintenance technology, process and quality control, spare parts management, and maintenance economic management. In modern enterprises, management is inseparable from technology, while the effective application of engineering technologies relies on sound management practices. Equipment engineering technicians, who are well-versed in equipment maintenance management principles and methods, should seamlessly integrate technical expertise with managerial skills. To this end, this section will outline the key aspects, methodologies, and practical applications of equipment maintenance management. 1.5.2 Information Management for Equipment Maintenance In corporate equipment maintenance activities, it is often necessary to make various technical and economic decisions, and the basis for these decisions is information. Breath. Without a systematic and reliable information system, effective management becomes difficult to implement. Therefore, the task of equipment maintenance information management is to establish a comprehensive information system that collects, stores, and organizes all types of equipment-related data, while also enabling data processing, output, and feedback—ultimately supporting informed economic and technical decision-making for equipment management. 1. Classification of Equipment Maintenance Information Equipment maintenance information can be complex, but it can generally be categorized using the following methods. 1) Categorized by equipment in the early versus later stages This classification method divides equipment information into two major systems—early-stage and later-stage—and further breaks them down into numerous subsystems. Within these subsystems, various types of equipment are grouped, ultimately leading to a detailed breakdown for each individual device. The approach is straightforward and clear, making it easy to process, organize, and access the information. 2) Categorized by equipment management objectives and performance indicators
(1) Basis for preparing the maintenance plan. ① The technical condition of equipment refers to its actual state in terms of technical performance, load capacity, transmission mechanisms, and operational safety. Key indicators reflecting the quality of a company’s equipment—including equipment integrity rate, failure downtime rate, and the extent to which equipment impacts balanced production—provide a clear picture of the overall technical condition. Information on equipment’s technical status is primarily gathered through comprehensive surveys and assessments of equipment conditions, as well as from original documentation. Typically, companies conduct equipment surveys during the third quarter of each year, with the main objective of identifying existing issues, proposing corrective measures, and completing the Equipment Technical Condition Survey Form, which then serves as the foundation for developing maintenance plans. Original records include daily inspections, routine checks, condition-monitoring logs, repair histories, and other primary documents, along with comprehensive analytical data. Equipment showing signs of deteriorating technical conditions and requiring maintenance should be included as items in the annual maintenance plan application. ② Requirements for equipment based on production processes and product quality. If the actual technical condition of the equipment fails to meet the process and quality standards for the product, the process department will submit a request to schedule planned maintenance."

It involves integrating maintenance activities with technological upgrades, ensuring that after repairs, key aspects such as precision, performance, and efficiency of the equipment are improved. Rate. During operation, mechanical and electrical equipment often has certain weak links, which necessitates technical improvements and structural modifications to specific devices or components. These enhancements aim to boost reliability and elevate the overall technological level of the equipment, ultimately leading to better economic outcomes. A key feature of improvement-based maintenance is its integrated approach, frequently combined with major overhauls and targeted repairs in actual production settings. When implementing such improvement maintenance, it’s essential to systematically address and refine the mechanisms of the equipment, as well as enhance the diagnostic and repair capabilities of electromechanical systems—based on thorough inspection and analysis of component failures. 10
6 The procedure for equipment failure management is outlined below. (1) Conduct thorough education and awareness campaigns to ensure that operators and maintenance personnel voluntarily comply with relevant rules and regulations regarding operation, maintenance, inspection, etc., properly use and carefully maintain equipment, and diligently record, compile statistics, and analyze any equipment malfunctions. (2) Based on the company’s actual production conditions, equipment status, and specific features, determine the key areas for equipment failure management. (3) Use monitoring instruments and diagnostic techniques to systematically monitor critical equipment, enabling timely detection of fault indicators and deterioration. Information on equipment condition. Typically, equipment can undergo daily inspections, routine patrols, and periodic checks (including precision assessments), as well as integrity assessments—using human senses and common diagnostic tools—to closely monitor the technical status and any unusual signs in components, mechanisms, and areas prone to failure. At the same time, inspection standards should be established to clearly define the boundaries between normal operation, abnormalities, and equipment failures. (4) To quickly locate the fault location and its cause, in addition to providing training to ensure that maintenance and operational staff acquire a solid understanding of electrical and hydraulic technologies, it is also essential to compile common equipment failure symptoms, analysis procedures, and troubleshooting methods into a fault-finding logic flowchart. This will enable operators to swiftly identify the source and root cause of any malfunction after it occurs, allowing for timely diagnosis, repair, and restoration of equipment functionality. (5) Improve the fault recording system. Fault records serve as the foundational data for effective fault management and also provide the original basis for conducting fault analysis and troubleshooting. Records must be complete and accurate. After on-site inspections and fault repairs, maintenance personnel should follow the ""Equipment Carefully complete the  ""Equipment Failure Repair Form "" and submit monthly statistical analyses to the equipment management department. (6) Conduct timely statistics and analysis of equipment failures. In addition to monitoring failure situations on a daily basis, staff members should compile  ""Failure Repair Forms "" and maintenance records on a monthly basis. By systematically collecting, organizing, and analyzing failure data, it’s possible to calculate the failure frequency and mean time between failures for each type of equipment. Furthermore, this process allows for an in-depth analysis of individual equipment failure trends and identifies key root causes, helping to pinpoint recurring patterns. Armed with this insight, teams can prioritize their response strategies effectively. Finally, the compiled and analyzed failure information should be shared back with the planning department, enabling them to schedule preventive maintenance or implement improvement measures. This data can also serve as a valuable reference for adjusting the intervals, content, and standards of routine inspections. (7) Implement different countermeasures based on the nature of the failure, the type of fault, and the specific characteristics of the equipment. For newly acquired equipment, strengthen management during the initial phase of use—carefully monitor and document the equipment’s precision, performance, and any emerging defects from the outset. During operation, emphasize routine maintenance, regular patrol inspections, and periodic checks to promptly identify early warning signs and take appropriate adjustment or troubleshooting actions. For critical equipment, conduct condition monitoring and diagnostics. Establish a flexible and responsive maintenance team equipped with advanced technical expertise, employing rapid repair techniques such as component-by-component fixes or group-based replacements. Ensure timely availability of high-quality spare parts, leverage production downtime for equipment overhauls, and apply measures like retrofitting or replacing components when wear patterns have been thoroughly understood. (8) Carry out routine maintenance tasks effectively to control equipment failures. Utilize status information and early warning signs of potential issues gathered during daily rounds by regional maintenance workers, as well as scheduled equipment condition checks, along with relevant records and analysis data. Based on the specific characteristics of each type of equipment and the general defects already identified, the workshop’s equipment mechanic (technician) or maintenance team leader should promptly schedule routine repairs—ideally during production downtime or weekend slots—to proactively address problems before they escalate, thereby minimizing breakdowns. For certain failure indicators or hidden risks that exceed the scope of routine maintenance, these should be reported back to the planning department for scheduling dedicated, planned maintenance activities instead. (9) Establish a rational fault information management flowchart.
1.2.4 Use of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment During operation, equipment's technical condition changes—and its performance gradually declines—due to various forces acting upon it, as well as factors such as environmental conditions, usage methods, operational guidelines, and the duration of use. To effectively manage these changes in technical condition and slow down the decline in equipment performance, the most critical measure is to ensure the equipment is used properly and correctly. Maintenance of mechanical and electrical equipment is a crucial method for improving utilization and ensuring its functionality—it consists of two forms: daily maintenance and periodic maintenance. Daily maintenance is primarily carried out by operators of mechanical and electrical equipment—conducting pre-shift inspections and post-shift cleaning to ensure that the equipment remains in optimal technical condition. Regular maintenance, also known as Level 1 care, is carried out by operators with assistance from maintenance personnel. It’s similar to minor repairs and is covered in Chapter 1 of the  ""Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance. "" 13
28 Determine the form and compensation method for the error compensation环节, ensuring assembly accuracy among all components—such as parallelism, coaxiality, perpendicularity, and the required meshing precision of the transmission. 3) Post-Repair Acceptance Phase All equipment that has undergone repair, assembly, and adjustment must be subjected to comprehensive precision checks and tests—such as geometric accuracy inspections, no-load running tests, load tests, and working precision evaluations—in accordance with the relevant prescribed accuracy standards or the precision criteria established prior to repair. These measures ensure a thorough assessment of the repaired equipment’s quality, restored precision, and overall performance. After equipment maintenance, record the modifications made to the original technical documentation and document any lessons learned during the repair process. Prepare a thorough post-repair summary and file it alongside the original documents for future reference during the next maintenance task. 2. Determining the Equipment Maintenance Plan Major equipment overhauls must not only meet the predetermined technical requirements but also strive to enhance economic efficiency. Therefore, before starting repairs, it’s essential to thoroughly assess the equipment’s technical condition, develop a practical and feasible repair plan, and ensure comprehensive preparation—both technically and in terms of production readiness. During the repair process, actively incorporate new technologies, materials, processes, and modern management techniques, while diligently managing technical, financial, and organizational aspects to guarantee high-quality workmanship, minimize downtime, and reduce overall maintenance costs. A pre-inspection must be conducted to thoroughly assess the equipment's technical condition before repairs, identify the main defects present, and analyze the product-specific process requirements that influence the equipment's technical specifications—allowing for the immediate development of a repair plan. 3. Technical Preparation Before Equipment Maintenance Preparation for equipment maintenance involves two key aspects: technical preparation and production readiness. The technical preparation prior to maintenance is the responsibility of the lead technician, and its main tasks include pre-inspection planning and research, conducting the actual pre-inspection, and preparing comprehensive overhaul technical documentation. Meanwhile, production readiness before the overhaul is managed by personnel responsible for spare parts, materials, and tools, as well as the production planners from the maintenance unit. Their primary responsibilities encompass ordering, manufacturing, inspecting, and storing critical materials, spare parts, and specialized tools, gauges, and testing equipment—along with developing the overall maintenance production schedule. Pre-inspection survey preparation work To gain a comprehensive understanding of the specific condition of equipment degradation, schedule a shutdown inspection before the major overhaul—this is referred to as a pre-inspection. Before conducting the equipment pre-inspection, ensure the following preparatory investigations are completed. (1) Review the following equipment records: factory inspection reports; precision and performance verification records from equipment installation acceptance tests; details of all past equipment incidents, malfunctions, and repairs, including any remaining issues after repairs; records of all previous maintenance activities, including replaced or repaired components, as well as any unresolved problems left behind after servicing; and operational status monitoring logs and comprehensive equipment inspection records."

1.2 Basics of Equipment Maintenance 1.2.1 Maintenance Method The method of equipment maintenance carries the meaning of a maintenance strategy. Modern equipment management emphasizes applying different maintenance approaches to various types of equipment, underscoring that equipment repair should align with the objective principles governing the physical lifecycle of machinery and materials. This approach ensures production continuity while optimizing the efficient use of maintenance resources, ultimately achieving the most cost-effective outcome over the equipment's entire lifespan. Commonly used maintenance methods for electromechanical equipment include the following: Reactive Maintenance Post-failure maintenance, also known as breakdown maintenance, damage repair, or unplanned maintenance, refers to repairs carried out after mechanical and electrical equipment has malfunctioned—essentially, ""if it breaks, we fix it."" For certain critical equipment, post-failure maintenance should be minimized whenever possible; however, for devices that have minimal impact on production or are backed up by redundant units, opting for post-failure maintenance is often the most cost-effective approach. Preventive Maintenance Maintenance performed before mechanical and electrical equipment fails is called preventive maintenance. Its main benefits include reducing unexpected equipment failures, ensuring continuous production, integrating equipment upkeep and repair tasks into a structured plan—thereby minimizing unplanned disruptions in production—and ultimately improving equipment utilization, lowering maintenance costs, and extending the equipment's natural lifespan. Preventive maintenance is categorized into two basic forms: Regular maintenance Regular maintenance is also known as planned maintenance or time-based preventive maintenance. It involves carrying out preventive maintenance activities at predetermined intervals and follows a cyclical pattern. This type of maintenance is based on the wear patterns of components, with specific guidelines for setting maintenance intervals, defining maintenance categories, outlining maintenance tasks, and estimating the associated workload. However, this approach to maintenance can lead to certain challenges: First, when equipment is still in good technical condition and fully capable of continuing operation, it may undergo major over-maintenance simply because the scheduled interval has arrived—resulting in unnecessary repairs. Second, if a machine’s technical condition has already deteriorated to the point where it can no longer meet production requirements, but the prescribed maintenance interval hasn’t yet been reached, no repair plan will be implemented, leading to under-maintenance. This method is particularly well-suited for process-oriented production equipment or power systems where the wear patterns are well understood, and operations are stable and continuous—such as large-scale assembly line equipment or key machinery operating on automated production lines. Currently, China primarily implements two main types of equipment maintenance systems: the Planned Preventive Maintenance System and the Planned Warranty System. (1) Planned Preventive Maintenance System (referred to as Planned Pre-Maintenance). This system involves maintaining, inspecting, and repairing equipment according to its wear patterns, adhering to predetermined maintenance cycles and procedures, to ensure that the equipment consistently remains in optimal technical condition. Its key features are outlined below. ① Perform daily cleaning, inspection, lubrication, tightening, and adjustments on equipment as required to minimize wear and ensure proper operation. ② Conduct regular inspections and adjustments of the equipment's operational status and wear levels according to the prescribed schedule, ensuring that potential issues are promptly addressed. This allows you to monitor changes in the equipment's technical condition and adequately prepare the necessary resources for scheduled maintenance. ③ Conduct preventive maintenance on equipment in a planned and prepared manner. (2) The Planned Maintenance System (also known as the Maintenance and Repair System) is a equipment maintenance approach that combines routine upkeep with scheduled inspections and repairs. Its key features are outlined below. ① Based on the equipment's characteristics and condition, different maintenance categories and intervals are specified according to operational hours (such as production output and mileage).
2) Condition Monitoring and Maintenance This is a preventive maintenance approach based on the equipment's technical condition, carried out precisely when needed. It relies on condition monitoring and advanced diagnostic techniques to track the gradual deterioration of equipment over time. By leveraging highly predictive insights, this method allows for timely scheduling of preventive maintenance activities, which is why it’s also referred to as ""predictive maintenance."" At its core, this maintenance strategy integrates comprehensive data from various sources—such as inspections, routine upkeep, operational use, and repair activities—especially insights gained from diagnostics and monitoring. Through rigorous statistical analysis, it accurately assesses the extent of equipment degradation, identifies specific areas where failures may occur (or are likely to occur), and predicts trends in the equipment’s overall technical condition. Armed with this information, operators can then determine the most appropriate type of maintenance intervention. By doing so, organizations gain full control over maintenance activities, ensuring thorough preparation before repairs begin. Moreover, this approach enables seamless coordination with production schedules, maximizing equipment utilization while simultaneously extending the lifespan of critical components. However, this method does come with some drawbacks: it tends to be more expensive and requires sophisticated diagnostic capabilities. Additionally, it demands highly skilled technicians who can interpret complex data and make informed decisions. This approach is particularly well-suited for critical, high-value equipment, key assets on production lines, machinery that cannot be easily disassembled for inspection (such as precision machine tools), and systems whose failure could lead to significant environmental or public health concerns.
Material details, etc. 6. Maintenance-Free Design Maintenance-free design is the ideal goal for equipment maintenance—it refers to implementing improvement measures during the design phase of new machinery and electrical equipment to address common failures encountered during maintenance, aiming to minimize maintenance efforts or even eliminate the need for repairs altogether. 1.2.2 Maintenance Method Selection The purpose of maintenance is to ensure the reliable operation of equipment—specifically, to guarantee the dependable fulfillment of its intended use—and, at the same time, minimize maintenance costs. Therefore, the fundamental requirements for maintenance decisions are: ① Reliability must not fall below the permissible minimum value [R], meaning that ()[] R ≥ R(t); ② Maintenance costs (KI) must be kept as low as possible—or, alternatively, must not exceed a predetermined maintenance cost limit (KImin), i.e., K ≤ KImin. To optimize maintenance decisions, the first step should be to choose an appropriate maintenance approach. The six maintenance methods mentioned above each have a specific scope of applicability; however, their effectiveness can vary depending on how appropriately they are applied. To maximize equipment efficiency, minimize downtime-related losses, and reduce maintenance costs, it’s essential to select the most suitable approach based on the characteristics of mechatronic systems and the conditions under which they are used. Looking ahead, the trend in maintenance practices is shifting from routine preventive maintenance toward planned, periodic inspections—and then, based on inspection findings, scheduling timely condition-based repairs. As the technological sophistication of factory equipment continues to rise, with increasingly complex system designs and broader adoption of mechatronic solutions, production activities are becoming more reliant on equipment performance and reliability. Consequently, the traditional static approach to maintenance management is evolving into a more dynamic model, gradually moving toward advanced strategies such as reliability-centered maintenance and quality-focused repair practices. Mechatronic equipment comes in a wide variety of types and is widely applied, making it essential to select one or a combination of maintenance methods tailored to the specific situation. When choosing a maintenance approach for mechatronic systems, reliability typically becomes the primary focus. For critical components, implementing condition-based monitoring allows for timely preventive measures. Meanwhile, for equipment at quality control points, it’s crucial to closely track changes in product quality during the manufacturing process and promptly address any detected anomalies through quality repairs. Additionally, it’s important to equip teams with personnel who are well-versed in microelectronics technology, providing them with supervision and guidance while fostering the development of skilled, integrated mechatronics technicians. Regular inspections and logical fault analysis should be conducted on CNC and other mechatronic systems, and any failed components identified must be promptly replaced and properly adjusted to ensure optimal performance. 1.2.3 Maintenance System Maintenance work is not only a technical task but also a managerial one. A maintenance system refers to a set of guidelines established under specific maintenance theories and principles, encompassing elements such as maintenance plans, categories, methods, timing, scope, levels, organizational structures, and performance evaluation metrics. Implementing a rational maintenance system helps optimize the allocation of human, material, and financial resources, enabling timely preparation before maintenance tasks, ensuring repairs are carried out appropriately, meeting operational requirements, enhancing the technical condition, reliability, and service life of机电 equipment, reducing downtime, and minimizing maintenance costs and production losses due to equipment shutdowns. Meanwhile, maintenance systems are continuously evolving and improving—currently, the main approaches include the following: Planned Preventive Maintenance System It is based on a thorough understanding of the wear and failure patterns of mechanical and electrical equipment, applying the principle of prevention being better than cure—and addressing potential issues before they escalate—by systematically organizing maintenance and repairs according to the rate of wear and expected service life of each component. This approach helps prevent premature wear, compensates for natural degradation, minimizes or avoids failures altogether, extends equipment lifespan, and ultimately saves time spent on repairs, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and boosting economic returns. The practical implementation of planned preventive maintenance can be summarized as ""regular inspections, timely upkeep, and scheduled repairs,"" making it particularly suitable for Chapter 1 of this guide: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment. 11 Macro-level management. Implementing a planned preventive maintenance system requires the following conditions: ① Determining the maintenance intervals for assemblies and key components through statistical analysis, measurements, and experimental studies, and rationally categorizing maintenance tasks;
③ Having well-equipped maintenance facilities organized according to functional divisions and strategically located for optimal efficiency. The main drawback of the planned preventive maintenance system is its poor cost-effectiveness. With fixed maintenance cycles and scopes, it often leads to unnecessary repairs of certain components—what’s known as over-maintenance. During the maintenance process, repairs are categorized into several levels and types based on the depth and breadth of the work required, including major overhauls, mid-level repairs, minor repairs, item-specific repairs, retrofits, and unplanned maintenance tasks—all determined by the scale and nature of the repair workload. (1) Overhaul: A comprehensive or fundamental restoration of the functionality of mechanical and electrical equipment, typically carried out by specialized maintenance teams within factories and mines—or at repair centers established in regions with a high concentration of industrial facilities. During an overhaul, the equipment is either fully or extensively disassembled, with a focus on repairing critical components, replacing or refurbishing parts that have lost their function or are on the verge of doing so. After the repairs, the equipment’s precision is restored to nearly its original factory specifications, while also receiving a fresh cosmetic overhaul to enhance its appearance. (2) Intermediate Overhaul. This is a level of maintenance that falls between major and minor overhauls, serving as a balanced approach to upkeep. (3) Minor Repair. This involves replacing or repairing components that have significantly worn out or are nearing failure within the maintenance interval, without addressing any underlying structural issues. It is a troubleshooting-based repair aimed at restoring functionality. The three levels—major overhaul, mid-term repair, and minor repair—objectively reflect the chronological progression of机电 equipment, making them ideally suited for implementing time-based planned preventive maintenance, a practice widely adopted by most organizations. However, these levels still require complementary repair tiers to address unforeseen maintenance needs effectively. (4) Item-based maintenance. Based on condition monitoring of mechanical and electrical equipment, this involves proactively planning repairs specifically for components or technical items that are about to fail. Item-based maintenance is conducted between major, medium, and minor overhauls—it’s a non-periodic, planned maintenance level that doesn’t follow a fixed cycle. (5) Retrofitting. This involves making localized modifications to existing mechanical and electrical equipment using new technologies, materials, structures, and processes, with the goal of enhancing its precision, functionality, productivity, and reliability. Such repairs are classified as improvement-oriented, and the extent of the work required depends on how well the original equipment’s design accommodates the retrofitting process—as well as on the specific level of performance enhancement desired for the equipment. Retrofitting is also referred to as modernization or upgrading. (6) Unscheduled Maintenance. This is a level of maintenance required for mechanical and electrical equipment due to sudden breakdowns and accidents. The fewer the number and scope of unscheduled maintenance activities, the higher the level of management.
12 As a basis for determining equipment condition; it requires close collaboration between the design, manufacturing, and maintenance departments to develop a comprehensive maintenance plan for mechanical and electrical equipment, along with access to necessary testing methods and standards. 3. Targeted Maintenance System This maintenance system is based on comprehensive management principles and reliability-centered maintenance thinking, adopting a practical approach tailored to the specific characteristics of mechanical and electrical equipment—such as their design, performance, and operating conditions. Building upon the implementation of a condition-based inspection system, it strategically incorporates various maintenance methods, including predictive maintenance, preventive maintenance, and corrective maintenance. By leveraging advanced decision-making tools, computer technologies, as well as state monitoring and fault diagnosis techniques, the system ensures that maintenance activities are conducted in a scientifically sound manner. Ultimately, this approach aims to minimize the total lifecycle costs of equipment while maximizing overall operational efficiency and profitability. The characteristics of the targeted maintenance system are as follows: (1) It adopts and refines the classification management approach, strengthening maintenance management for key mechanical and electrical equipment as well as critical areas. Moreover, it implements tailored maintenance strategies based on the specific characteristics and current condition of each asset, maximizing their respective suitability and effectiveness to achieve optimal maintenance outcomes. (2) Among various maintenance approaches, condition monitoring and predictive maintenance should be promoted as the primary methods. Implement a systematic inspection system that embodies reliability-centered thinking, focusing maintenance efforts on routine upkeep while striving for targeted, proactive interventions whenever possible. (3) Emphasize the role of information, leverage computer technology for dynamic management, and make timely decisions to ensure that maintenance efforts are truly targeted and effective. The content of the targeted maintenance system includes: ① implementing a periodic inspection system, categorizing mechanical and electrical equipment, and applying various maintenance methods in a targeted manner; ② enhancing planned preventive maintenance by adopting maintenance type decisions for equipment equipped with condition-monitoring systems, allowing for tailored corrective or major overhauls; ③ establishing a set of maintenance and inspection standards, along with standardized work-hour quotas; ④ introducing computer-aided dynamic management, including decision-support systems for all relevant processes. 4. Operation and Maintenance System This is a standardized requirement for personnel behavior, serving as an essential software engineering practice in机电 equipment management, and it primarily consists of five disciplines and four key requirements. Five disciplines: ① Implement operator-specific machine assignments; ② Maintain cleanliness of mechanical and electrical equipment, ensuring proper lubrication and maintenance; ③ Follow safety operating procedures and the shift handover system; ④ Properly manage tools and accessories; ⑤ Immediately stop and inspect the machine upon detecting any malfunction. Four requirements: ① Neatness; ② Cleanliness; ③ Lubrication; ④ Safety."

6) Use correctly Under normal operating conditions, mechanical equipment follows its own failure patterns; however, when operating conditions change, these failure patterns also shift accordingly. The primary operating conditions include the following: (1) Load. The primary causes of wear and fatigue failure in mechanical equipment are the wear of components and their fatigue-induced damage. Under specified operating conditions, the rate of component wear over a given period is directly proportional to the magnitude of the load applied. Meanwhile, fatigue damage to components occurs only under certain types of cyclic loading and intensifies as the load increases. Thus, both wear and fatigue are functions of the applied load. Exceeding the design-rated load levels can lead to severe failure, which is unacceptable. (2) Environment. The environment includes the effects of climate, corrosive media, and other harmful substances, as well as the condition of the working object itself. Increased temperatures accelerate wear and corrosion, while excessively high humidity and corrosive agents present in the air can lead to both corrosion and corrosive wear. Additionally, excessive dust levels in the air and harsh operating conditions often contribute to equipment failures. However, the environment is an objective factor, and in certain situations, measures can be taken manually to improve it. (3) Maintenance and Operation. Establishing a sound maintenance system and strictly adhering to technical maintenance guidelines and operational procedures are crucial for ensuring the reliable performance of mechanical equipment and extending its service life. Additionally, it is essential to provide training for personnel to enhance their skills and expertise.

Cultivate a culture and habit of consciously caring for equipment, ensuring it remains regularly clean, safe, and in optimal technical condition. 1.2.5 Maintenance and保养 of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment 1) Principles of Operation and Maintenance Procedures Mechanical and electrical equipment maintenance refers to the tasks performed to eliminate inevitable abnormal technical conditions that arise during operation (such as loose parts, dry friction, or unusual noises). Overall, maintaining mechanical and electrical equipment requires meeting four fundamental criteria: neatness, cleanliness, lubrication, and safety. Developing clear equipment operation and maintenance procedures is a crucial step in ensuring that all subsequent operations are carried out systematically and efficiently. The principles for creating these operational and maintenance guidelines are outlined below. (1) General guidelines should list precautions according to the equipment operation sequence, as well as before, during, and after shifts—aiming for concise, clear, and practical content. (2) List the structural features, processing range, operational precautions, maintenance requirements, and more separately by equipment category, making it easier for operators to grasp the key points and ensure proper implementation. (3) Common elements across various types of mechanical and electrical equipment can be used to develop a unified, standard general procedure. (4) Key equipment, high-precision, large and medium-sized, as well as rare and critical electromechanical devices, must have operation and maintenance procedures prepared separately. Also, post prominent signage near the machine tool, clearly indicating that operators should pay special attention and strictly adhere to the guidelines. 2) Basic Content of Operation and Maintenance Procedures
The basic content of operation and maintenance procedures generally includes the following aspects. (1) Operators must wear appropriate personal protective equipment as required during operation. When inspecting or approaching the equipment, they should avoid wearing loose-fitting clothing. Female employees are not permitted to wear long hair loose. (2) Before starting work, clear the workspace. Before turning on the equipment, inspect each operating handle and control device according to the items specified in the daily inspection checklist to ensure they are in the off position. Check whether any components show signs of severe wear, damage requiring replacement, or loose connections posing safety risks. Verify that all safety protection devices are intact and securely fastened. Also, confirm that the power supply is functioning properly and keep a detailed inspection record. If any issues are found that fail to meet safety standards, promptly submit safety improvement suggestions or solutions to the workshop supervisor to prevent the equipment from operating while faulty. (3) Check whether the wires and control cabinets are damaged, whether the surrounding environment is reliable, and whether the equipment's grounding or earthing facilities are safe. If any issues are detected, take protective measures immediately. (4) Check the oil quality and level in lubrication and hydraulic systems; replenish oil according to the lubrication chart, ensuring the oil remains clean, the oil lines are unobstructed, and lubrication is optimal. Proper lubrication not only guarantees effective cooling and heat dissipation but also provides sealing and protective functions. Additionally, it plays a significant role in cleaning away contaminants and reducing wear. (5) After confirming that all components are functioning correctly, you may first run the machine at low speed for 3–5 minutes with no load. Ensure that all parts operate smoothly and are well-lubricated before proceeding with actual work. Never exceed the recommended load or use the equipment outside of specified guidelines. (6) While the equipment is running, it is strictly prohibited to adjust the workpiece by hand or to perform lubrication, remove debris, or wipe down the machine. When leaving the machine tool, always turn off the power supply. During operation, closely monitor the condition of all components; if any abnormalities are detected, immediately stop the machine and address the issue. (7) When maintaining, servicing, or cleaning equipment and instruments, ensure that the equipment and instruments are powered down and the power supply is completely turned off. Additionally, clearly display or hang warning signs at the work site to indicate that the equipment is undergoing maintenance or repair, or that personnel are present for ongoing work. (8) Before maintenance and servicing, personnel should be aware of the precautions specific to this task and follow the proper maintenance procedures. During maintenance, staff must remain fully focused, wear appropriate safety gear, and ensure their standing position is secure. (9) When maintaining equipment, use disassembly tools correctly; unauthorized assembly or disassembly is strictly prohibited. Do not remove or alter the equipment's Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance at will. 15 Safety protection device: When positioning or assembling the equipment, never insert your hands into the mating surfaces or use your fingers to align holes. (10) After completing maintenance, repair, and other operational tasks, equipment should be removed from the work area, and the workspace along with machinery must be thoroughly cleaned. Every component of the equipment’s instruments and gauges should be carefully inspected, ensuring that no tools or other items are left behind—either on the equipment or inside it. Additionally, the workshop should conduct regular maintenance, upkeep, and repairs to ensure the smooth operation of all machinery. (11) Instructions, safety signs, and signage located within the workshop and on machinery must be strictly followed at all times. (12) It is strictly prohibited to use flammable or volatile substances for wiping equipment. Oil-soaked rags must not be left on the equipment, and no flammable or explosive materials are allowed to be stored near the equipment. (13) When working in flammable and explosive hazard areas, appropriate safety measures must be taken beforehand and approved by the production safety department and management before proceeding. Additionally, when welding or grinding containers or pipelines containing flammable, explosive, or toxic materials, these must first be properly purged and thoroughly cleaned—and all openings must be fully opened—before work can begin. (14) The work area should be dry and clean. Used oil and waste rags must not be discarded randomly on the floor. Raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished goods must be neatly stacked, and blocking passageways is strictly prohibited. (15) Regularly maintain the cleanliness of lubrication and hydraulic systems. Keep the tank lid securely closed, ensuring no water, dust, metal chips, or other contaminants enter the oil tank or electrical equipment. (16) After finishing work and before leaving for the day, clean the machine tools and equipment thoroughly, ensuring they remain tidy. Return operating handles, buttons, and other controls to their non-working positions, turn off the power supply, and complete the handover procedures with the next shift. 3) Classification of Maintenance and Servicing Tasks Depending on the depth, scope, and volume of work involved in equipment maintenance and upkeep, maintenance tasks can be categorized into the following types. (1) Daily Maintenance (Routine Maintenance). Its main tasks include: inspecting and lubricating the equipment; strictly following the equipment operation procedures. Cheng uses the equipment to tighten any loose parts; cleans and wipes down the equipment, checks its operational status, and records the condition in the shift handover log. This type of maintenance is relatively simple, with most tasks performed on the equipment's surface. Daily maintenance should be carried out by the operating person. (2) First-Level Maintenance (Monthly Maintenance). The main tasks include: disassembling specified components such as the housing cover and protective shields, thoroughly cleaning and wiping both the inside and outside of the equipment; inspecting and adjusting clearance gaps between parts, tightening any loose components, and replacing individual wear-and-tear parts; clearing oil passages, cleaning filters, and replacing coolant while also flushing the coolant tank; cleaning guideways and sliding surfaces, removing burrs and scratches; and inspecting and adjusting electrical wiring and related devices. This first-level maintenance is performed after the equipment has been running for 1 to 2 months (under a two-shift system), primarily by operational staff with support from maintenance technicians. (3) Second-Level Maintenance (Annual Maintenance). In addition to the tasks included in first-level maintenance, second-level maintenance also involves repairing or replacing worn parts, adjusting clearances in components such as guides, maintaining the electrical system, and inspecting and fine-tuning equipment accuracy. This type of maintenance is carried out once a year after the equipment has been in operation, primarily by maintenance technicians with the participation of operators."

Context:  
3) By the rate at which the fault develops (1) Sudden failures. These failures occur unexpectedly and spontaneously, typically independent of the equipment’s usage time. They are often preceded by no obvious warning signs, making them difficult to predict even through early-stage testing or trials. Such failures usually result from a combination of inherent adverse factors within the process system and unpredictable external influences. (2) Gradual failure. These failures develop slowly and typically occur during the later stages of an electromechanical device's useful life. Their likelihood of occurrence is closely tied to the equipment's usage time, and they can often be predicted through early-stage testing or monitoring. Such failures usually result from the gradual progression of issues like corrosion, wear, fatigue, and material aging in the components. 4) By the cause of fault formation (1) Failures caused by operational or management errors, such as using机电 equipment under conditions that deviate from the original design specifications, leading to improper equipment usage. (2) Failures caused by inherent system factors. These typically arise from defects left over from system design or manufacturing—such as residual stresses or localized weak points—or from latent flaws within the materials themselves. Such failures are unpredictable and represent a major cause of sudden, unexpected breakdowns. (3) Natural failures. During the operational and maintenance period, mechanical and electrical equipment may experience failures caused by various external or internal natural factors—such as wear, fracture, corrosion, deformation, creep, aging, and other forms of damage that occur under normal conditions. 5) By the consequences caused by the failure (1) Critical Failure: A failure that endangers personal safety, results in injury or death, causes the scrapping of机电 equipment, or leads to significant financial losses. Examples include frame or body separation, wheel detachment, and complete engine assembly failure. (2) Minor faults. These are issues that affect the normal operation of mechanical and electrical equipment but can be resolved within a relatively short time. Examples include broken drive belts, damaged control handles, cracks or loose welds in sheet metal components, faulty electrical switches, minor leaks, and loose general fasteners. 6) By the period when the fault occurred (1) Early-stage failures. These faults may arise from design, manufacturing, or material defects and typically become apparent shortly after the equipment is first put into operation. Alternatively, certain components—such as gear pairs in gearboxes or other friction-based assemblies—often require an initial ""running-in"" period before their performance gradually improves. Once these early-stage issues are identified, addressed, and optimized, the failure rate tends to decline over time. (2) Failure during the useful life. This refers to failures that occur within a product's effective lifespan, caused by unpredictable, random factors related to both external loads (such as operational conditions) and intrinsic system characteristics (including internal factors like component failures or structural damage). Since equipment typically operates in this condition for most of its lifetime, the failure rate during this period remains relatively constant. Therefore, monitoring and diagnosing failures during this phase is critically important. (3) Late-stage failures (dissipation-phase failures). These typically occur during the latter part of a device's lifespan, often after the equipment has been in use for an extended period—or even beyond its intended service life. Such failures arise due to gradual wear, fatigue, and aging of the equipment's components, leading to a decline in system functionality. Ultimately, this can result in sudden, hazardous, and potentially widespread system breakdowns. During this phase, the failure rate of the equipment tends to increase steadily. To prevent accidents, it’s crucial to monitor and diagnose the system regularly, promptly replacing any identified failing components before they cause a major incident. As illustrated by the classification of these failures, mechanical and electrical equipment malfunctions are often interconnected and can evolve over time—shifting from one type of failure to another. Ultimately, every type of machinery and equipment failure will manifest as a specific issue, underscoring the importance of comprehensive diagnostic and maintenance strategies. 5
6 The procedure for equipment failure management is outlined below. (1) Conduct thorough education and awareness campaigns to ensure that operators and maintenance personnel voluntarily comply with relevant rules and regulations regarding operation, maintenance, inspection, etc., properly use and carefully maintain equipment, and diligently record, compile statistics, and analyze any equipment malfunctions. (2) Based on the company’s actual production conditions, equipment status, and specific features, determine the key areas for equipment failure management. (3) Use monitoring instruments and diagnostic techniques to systematically monitor critical equipment, enabling timely detection of fault indicators and deterioration. Information on equipment condition. Typically, equipment can undergo daily inspections, routine patrols, and periodic checks (including precision assessments), as well as integrity assessments—using human senses and common diagnostic tools—to closely monitor the technical status and any unusual signs in components, mechanisms, and areas prone to failure. At the same time, inspection standards should be established to clearly define the boundaries between normal operation, abnormalities, and equipment failures. (4) To quickly locate the fault location and its cause, in addition to providing training to ensure that maintenance and operational staff acquire a solid understanding of electrical and hydraulic technologies, it is also essential to compile common equipment failure symptoms, analysis procedures, and troubleshooting methods into a fault-finding logic flowchart. This will enable operators to swiftly identify the source and root cause of any malfunction after it occurs, allowing for timely diagnosis, repair, and restoration of equipment functionality. (5) Improve the fault recording system. Fault records serve as the foundational data for effective fault management and also provide the original basis for conducting fault analysis and troubleshooting. Records must be complete and accurate. After on-site inspections and fault repairs, maintenance personnel should follow the ""Equipment Carefully complete the  ""Equipment Failure Repair Form "" and submit monthly statistical analyses to the equipment management department. (6) Conduct timely statistics and analysis of equipment failures. In addition to monitoring failur e situations on a daily basis, staff members should compile  ""Failure Repair Forms "" and maintenance records on a monthly basis. By systematically collecting, organizing, and analyzing failure data, it’s possible to calculate the failure frequency and mean time b etween failures for each type of equipment. Furthermore, this process allows for an in-depth analysis of individual equipment failure trends and identifies key root causes, helping  to pinpoint recurring patterns. Armed with this insight, teams can prioritize their response strategies effectively. Finally, the compiled and analyzed failure information should  be shared back with the planning department, enabling them to schedule preventive maintenance or implement improvement measures. This data can also serve as a valuable reference fo r adjusting the intervals, content, and standards of routine inspections. (7) Implement different countermeasures based on the nature of the failure, the type of fault, and the spe cific characteristics of the equipment. For newly acquired equipment, strengthen management during the initial phase of use—carefully monitor and document the equipment’s precision , performance, and any emerging defects from the outset. During operation, emphasize routine maintenance, regular patrol inspections, and periodic checks to promptly identify early  warning signs and take appropriate adjustment or troubleshooting actions. For critical equipment, conduct condition monitoring and diagnostics. Establish a flexible and responsive  maintenance team equipped with advanced technical expertise, employing rapid repair techniques such as component-by-component fixes or group-based replacements. Ensure timely avai lability of high-quality spare parts, leverage production downtime for equipment overhauls, and apply measures like retrofitting or replacing components when wear patterns have bee n thoroughly understood. (8) Carry out routine maintenance tasks effectively to control equipment failures. Utilize status information and early warning signs of potential issues g athered during daily rounds by regional maintenance workers, as well as scheduled equipment condition checks, along with relevant records and analysis data. Based on the specific c haracteristics of each type of equipment and the general defects already identified, the workshop’s equipment mechanic (technician) or maintenance team leader should promptly sched ule routine repairs—ideally during production downtime or weekend slots—to proactively address problems before they escalate, thereby minimizing breakdowns. For certain failure ind icators or hidden risks that exceed the scope of routine maintenance, these should be reported back to the planning department for scheduling dedicated, planned maintenance activit ies instead. (9) Establish a rational fault information management flowchart.
1.2.4 Use of Mechanical and Elect rical Equipment During operation, equipment's technical condition changes—and its performance gradually declines—due to various forces acting upon it, as well as factors such as en vironmental conditions, usage methods, operational guidelines, and the duration of use. To effectively manage these changes in technical condition and slow down the decline in equi pment performance, the most critical measure is to ensure the equipment is used properly and correctly. Maintenance of mechanical and electrical equipment is a crucial method for i mproving utilization and ensuring its functionality—it consists of two forms: daily maintenance and periodic maintenance. Daily maintenance is primarily carried out by operators of  mechanical and electrical equipment—conducting pre-shift inspections and post-shift cleaning to ensure that the equipment remains in optimal technical condition. Regular maintenan ce, also known as Level 1 care, is carried out by operators with assistance from maintenance personnel. It’s similar to minor repairs and is covered in Chapter 1 of the  ""Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance. "" 13
6. Develop effective operating procedures, establish a sound e quipment usage accountability system, and strictly adhere to them during operation. Establishing and adhering to operating procedures is one of the key measures to ensure the safe  operation of equipment. Leaders at all levels within the enterprise, as well as equipment management departments, production team leaders, and production workers, all bear correspo nding responsibilities in ensuring the proper use of equipment. Practical experience has shown that many equipment failures can be significantly reduced simply by following establi shed operating procedures. 7. Pre-employment Training for Operators Operators must be thoroughly familiar with and proficient in the equipment’s performance, structure, processing  capabilities, and maintenance procedures. New operators are required to undergo a technical assessment before operating the machine; only those who pass can independently perform s etup tasks. For precision, complex, or critical production equipment, designated operators with specialized expertise should be assigned—adhering to the principle of  ""designated personnel for specific machines, operating only with proper certification. "" Additionally, employees should receive ongoing education and training on the proper use and care of equipment. The level of care operators demonstrate toward machinery directly i mpacts the equipment’s lifespan and operational efficiency. Therefore, companies must regularly provide employees with both ideological guidance and technical training, equipping t hem with the skills needed to diagnose and troubleshoot mechanical and electrical system failures effectively. 14
1.2.7 Patterns of Failure Occurrence Mechanical and electrical equipment failures exhibit two notable characteristics: first, the likelihood of failure increases as the equipment ages; second, failures occur randomly, making it difficult to predict the exact timing of any given failure. Consequently, over the equipment's lifespan, the probability of a failure can be expressed using statistical methods. The failure rate, denoted by ( \lambda(t) ), represents the conditional probability that a failure will occur within the infinitesimal time interval ( dt ), given that no failure has yet happened up to time ( t ).

1.2 Basics of Equipment Maintenance 1.2.1 Maintenance Method The method of equipment maintenance carries the meaning of a maintenance strategy. Modern equipment management emphasizes applying different maintenance approaches to various types of equipment, underscoring that equipment repair should align with the objective principles governing the physical lifecycle of machinery and materials. This approach ensures production continuity while optimizing the efficient use of maintenance resources, ultimately achieving the most cost-effective outcome over the equipment's entire lifespan. Commonly used maintenance methods for electromechanical equipment include the following: Reactive Maintenance Post-failure maintenance, also known as breakdown maintenance, damage repair, or unplanned maintenance, refers to repairs carried out after mechanical and electrical equipment has malfunctioned—essentially, ""if it breaks, we fix it."" For certain critical equipment, post-failure maintenance should be minimized whenever possible; however, for devices that have minimal impact on production or are backed up by redundant units, opting for post-failure maintenance is often the most cost-effective approach. Preventive Maintenance Maintenance performed before mechanical and electrical equipment fails is called preventive maintenance. Its main benefits include reducing unexpected equipment failures, ensuring continuous production, integrating equipment upkeep and repair tasks into a structured plan—thereby minimizing unplanned disruptions in production—and ultimately improving equipment utilization, lowering maintenance costs, and extending the equipment's natural lifespan. Preventive maintenance is categorized into two basic forms: Regular maintenance Regular maintenance is also known as planned maintenance or time-based preventive maintenance. It involves carrying out preventive maintenance activities at predetermined intervals and follows a cyclical pattern. This type of maintenance is based on the wear patterns of components, with specific guidelines for setting maintenance intervals, defining maintenance categories, outlining maintenance tasks, and estimating the associated workload. However, this approach to maintenance can lead to certain challenges: First, when equipment is still in good technical condition and fully capable of continuing operation, it may undergo major over-maintenance simply because the scheduled interval has arrived—resulting in unnecessary repairs. Second, if a machine’s technical condition has already deteriorated to the point where it can no longer meet production requirements, but the prescribed maintenance interval hasn’t yet been reached, no repair plan will be implemented, leading to under-maintenance. This method is particularly well-suited for process-oriented production equipment or power systems where the wear patterns are well understood, and operations are stable and continuous—such as large-scale assembly line equipment or key machinery operating on automated production lines. Currently, China primarily implements two main types of equipment maintenance systems: the Planned Preventive Maintenance System and the Planned Warranty System. (1) Planned Preventive Maintenance System (referred to as Planned Pre-Maintenance). This system involves maintaining, inspecting, and repairing equipment according to its wear patterns, adhering to predetermined maintenance cycles and procedures, to ensure that the equipment consistently remains in optimal technical condition. Its key features are outlined below. ① Perform daily cleaning, inspection, lubrication, tightening, and adjustments on equipment as required to minimize wear and ensure proper operation. ② Conduct regular inspections and adjustments of the equipment's operational status and wear levels according to the prescribed schedule, ensuring that potential issues are promptly addressed. This allows you to monitor changes in the equipment's technical condition and adequately prepare the necessary resources for scheduled maintenance. ③ Conduct preventive maintenance on equipment in a planned and prepared manner. (2) The Planned Maintenance System (also known as the Maintenance and Repair System) is a equipment maintenance approach that combines routine upkeep with scheduled inspections and repairs. Its key features are outlined below. ① Based on the equipment's characteristics and condition, different maintenance categories and intervals are specified according to operational hours (such as production output and mileage).
2) Condition Monitoring and Maintenance This is a preventive maintenance approach based on the equipment's technical condition, carried out precisely when needed. It relies on condition monitoring and advanced diagnostic techniques to track the gradual deterioration of equipment over time. By leveraging highly predictive insights, this method allows for timely scheduling of preventive maintenance activities, which is why it’s also referred to as ""predictive maintenance."" At its core, this maintenance strategy integrates comprehensive data from various sources—such as inspections, routine upkeep, operational use, and repair activities—especially insights gained from diagnostics and monitoring. Through rigorous statistical analysis, it accurately assesses the extent of equipment degradation, identifies specific areas where failures may occur (or are likely to occur), and predicts trends in the equipment’s overall technical condition. Armed with this information, operators can then determine the most appropriate type of maintenance intervention. By doing so, organizations gain full control over maintenance activities, ensuring thorough preparation before repairs begin. Moreover, this approach enables seamless coordination with production schedules, maximizing equipment utilization while simultaneously extending the lifespan of critical components. However, this method does come with some drawbacks: it tends to be more expensive and requires sophisticated diagnostic capabilities. Additionally, it demands highly skilled technicians who can interpret complex data and make informed decisions. This approach is particularly well-suited for critical, high-value equipment, key assets on production lines, machinery that cannot be easily disassembled for inspection (such as precision machine tools), and systems whose failure could lead to significant environmental or public health concerns.
1.2.4 Use of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment During operation, equipment's technical condition changes—and its performance gradually declines—due to various forces acting upon it, as well as factors such as environmental conditions, usage methods, operational guidelines, and the duration of use. To effectively manage these changes in technical condition and slow down the decline in equipment performance, the most critical measure is to ensure the equipment is used properly and correctly. Maintenance of mechanical and electrical equipment is a crucial method for improving utilization and ensuring its functionality—it consists of two forms: daily maintenance and periodic maintenance. Daily maintenance is primarily carried out by operators of mechanical and electrical equipment—conducting pre-shift inspections and post-shift cleaning to ensure that the equipment remains in optimal technical condition. Regular maintenance, also known as Level 1 care, is carried out by operators with assistance from maintenance personnel. It’s similar to minor repairs and is covered in Chapter 1 of the ""Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance."" 13
The basic content of operation and maintenance procedures generally includes the following aspects. (1) Operators must wear appropriate personal protective equipment as required during operation. When inspecting or approaching the equipment, they should avoid wearing loose-fitting clothing. Female employees are not permitted to wear long hair loose. (2) Before starting work, clear the workspace. Before turning on the equipment, inspect each operating handle and control device according to the items specified in the daily inspection checklist to ensure they are in the off position. Check whether any components show signs of severe wear, damage requiring replacement, or loose connections posing safety risks. Verify that all safety protection devices are intact and securely fastened. Also, confirm that the power supply is functioning properly and keep a detailed inspection record. If any issues are found that fail to meet safety standards, promptly submit safety improvement suggestions or solutions to the workshop supervisor to prevent the equipment from operating while faulty. (3) Check whether the wires and control cabinets are damaged, whether the surrounding environment is reliable, and whether the equipment's grounding or earthing facilities are safe. If any issues are detected, take protective measures immediately. (4) Check the oil quality and level in lubrication and hydraulic systems; replenish oil according to the lubrication chart, ensuring the oil remains clean, the oil lines are unobstructed, and lubrication is optimal. Proper lubrication not only guarantees effective cooling and heat dissipation but also provides sealing and protective functions. Additionally, it plays a significant role in cleaning away contaminants and reducing wear. (5) After confirming that all components are functioning correctly, you may first run the machine at low speed for 3–5 minutes with no load. Ensure that all parts operate smoothly and are well-lubricated before proceeding with actual work. Never exceed the recommended load or use the equipment outside of specified guidelines. (6) While the equipment is running, it is strictly prohibited to adjust the workpiece by hand or to perform lubrication, remove debris, or wipe down the machine. When leaving the machine tool, always turn off the power supply. During operation, closely monitor the condition of all components; if any abnormalities are detected, immediately stop the machine and address the issue. (7) When maintaining, servicing, or cleaning equipment and instruments, ensure that the equipment and instruments are powered down and the power supply is completely turned off. Additionally, clearly display or hang warning signs at the work site to indicate that the equipment is undergoing maintenance or repair, or that personnel are present for ongoing work. (8) Before maintenance and servicing, personnel should be aware of the precautions specific to this task and follow the proper maintenance procedures. During maintenance, staff must remain fully focused, wear appropriate safety gear, and ensure their standing position is secure. (9) When maintaining equipment, use disassembly tools correctly; unauthorized assembly or disassembly is strictly prohibited. Do not remove or alter the equipment's Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance at will. 15 Safety protection device: When positioning or assembling the equipment, never insert your hands into the mating surfaces or use your fingers to align holes. (10) After completing maintenance, repair, and other operational tasks, equipment should be removed from the work area, and the workspace along with machinery must be thoroughly cleaned. Every component of the equipment’s instruments and gauges should be carefully inspected, ensuring that no tools or other items are left behind—either on the equipment or inside it. Additionally, the workshop should conduct regular maintenance, upkeep, and repairs to ensure the smooth operation of all machinery. (11) Instructions, safety signs, and signage located within the workshop and on machinery must be strictly followed at all times. (12) It is strictly prohibited to use flammable or volatile substances for wiping equipment. Oil-soaked rags must not be left on the equipment, and no flammable or explosive materials are allowed to be stored near the equipment. (13) When working in flammable and explosive hazard areas, appropriate safety measures must be taken beforehand and approved by the production safety department and management before proceeding. Additionally, when welding or grinding containers or pipelines containing flammable, explosive, or toxic materials, these must first be properly purged and thoroughly cleaned—and all openings must be fully opened—before work can begin. (14) The work area should be dry and clean. Used oil and waste rags must not be discarded randomly on the floor. Raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished goods must be neatly stacked, and blocking passageways is strictly prohibited. (15) Regularly maintain the cleanliness of lubrication and hydraulic systems. Keep the tank lid securely closed, ensuring no water, dust, metal chips, or other contaminants enter the oil tank or electrical equipment. (16) After finishing work and before leaving for the day, clean the machine tools and equipment thoroughly, ensuring they remain tidy. Return operating handles, buttons, and other controls to their non-working positions, turn off the power supply, and complete the handover procedures with the next shift. 3) Classification of Maintenance and Servicing Tasks Depending on the depth, scope, and volume of work involved in equipment maintenance and upkeep, maintenance tasks can be categorized into the following types. (1) Daily Maintenance (Routine Maintenance). Its main tasks include: inspecting and lubricating the equipment; strictly following the equipment operation procedures. Cheng uses the equipment to tighten any loose parts; cleans and wipes down the equipment, checks its operational status, and records the condition in the shift handover log. This type of maintenance is relatively simple, with most tasks performed on the equipment's surface. Daily maintenance should be carried out by the operating person. (2) First-Level Maintenance (Monthly Maintenance). The main tasks include: disassembling specified components such as the housing cover and protective shields, thoroughly cleaning and wiping both the inside and outside of the equipment; inspecting and adjusting clearance gaps between parts, tightening any loose components, and replacing individual wear-and-tear parts; clearing oil passages, cleaning filters, and replacing coolant while also flushing the coolant tank; cleaning guideways and sliding surfaces, removing burrs and scratches; and inspecting and adjusting electrical wiring and related devices. This first-level maintenance is performed after the equipment has been running for 1 to 2 months (under a two-shift system), primarily by operational staff with support from maintenance technicians. (3) Second-Level Maintenance (Annual Maintenance). In addition to the tasks included in first-level maintenance, second-level maintenance also involves repairing or replacing worn parts, adjusting clearances in components such as guides, maintaining the electrical system, and inspecting and fine-tuning equipment accuracy. This type of maintenance is carried out once a year after the equipment has been in operation, primarily by maintenance technicians with the participation of operators. 1.2.6 Equipment Fault Diagnosis Technology When equipment malfunctions, certain characteristics change accordingly, leading to variations in mechanical, thermal, acoustic, and electromagnetic physical and chemical parameters—each carrying distinct types of information. By capturing these altered indicators, detecting the underlying signals and patterns, and analyzing their causes and anomalies, fault diagnosis technology enables us to pinpoint the location, nature, and severity of the failure, as well as forecast future issues, assess damage conditions, make informed decisions, eliminate potential hazards, and ultimately prevent accidents from occurring. This is precisely what fault diagnosis technology aims to achieve. Mechatronic System Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance Case Studies Tutorial
The degree is very high. Choose a reasonable running-in load, relative motion speed, and lubrication. Slip conditions and other parameters are key to shortening the break-in period. 2) Stable Wear Phase AB The wear characteristic of this stage is a low and stable wear rate, which is why the duration of this phase is relatively long. But by mid- Figure 1.3: Wear Characteristic Curve – Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance 19 Later on, the wear rate becomes relatively faster, but the equipment can still function for a while. When the wear amount reaches point B, the wear rate sharply accelerates, marking the onset of the severe wear phase. Proper usage, along with regular maintenance and upkeep of the equipment, is key to extending this critical stage. 3) Rapid Wear Phase BC Once this stage is reached, significant changes in friction conditions occur, such as altered lubrication or shifts in the geometric dimensions of components. Changes, such as increased clearance between mating parts and the generation of impact loads, can cause wear rates to rise sharply. At this point, mechanical efficiency noticeably declines, and precision deteriorates—conditions that, if left unaddressed, could lead to equipment failure or even unexpected accidents. Therefore, promptly identifying and repairing components that are about to enter this stage is critically important. According to wear results, wear is categorized into pitting wear, adhesive wear, abrasive wear, and more; while based on wear mechanisms, it is classified into abrasive wear, fatigue wear, adhesive wear, fretting wear, and others. Abrasive wear occurs when a hard protruding part on one surface of a friction pair comes into contact with the other surface, or when abrasive particles are present between the two rubbing surfaces. Wear occurs when hard particulates—such as dust in the air or metal particles generated by abrasion—cause material transfer from one surface to another, or even simultaneous material loss on both surfaces, during relative motion. Among the many wear failure modes, abrasive wear is not only the most common but also the most severe type of failure. Fretting wear refers to a type of wear where localized areas on the surfaces of friction pairs develop fatigue cracks under cyclic contact stresses, leading to the detachment of micro-sheets or particles. Depending on the nature of contact and relative motion between the friction pairs, fretting wear can be categorized into two main forms: rolling-contact fatigue wear and sliding-contact fatigue wear. In practical applications, pure rolling-contact fatigue wear is relatively rare; most often, it occurs as a combination of rolling and sliding motions. Adhesive wear occurs when, at the points of contact between mating surfaces, ""cold welding"" takes place, causing material from one surface to transfer to the other during relative sliding. Micro-motion wear is a type of wear that occurs when two contacting objects undergo relative vibrations with very small amplitudes. It happens on two closely matched surfaces that appear nominally stationary but actually experience cyclic, minute-scale relative sliding—typically at the micrometer level (2–20 μm). For instance, this phenomenon can be observed at interference or transition-fit interfaces between shafts and holes, on keyway surfaces, or in threaded fasteners. Wear occurring on working surfaces, such as the working surface of the rivet, and other similar areas. Fretting wear not only reduces mating accuracy, loosens tight-fitting components, and degrades the quality of the mating surfaces, but can also lead to the formation of fatigue cracks, significantly diminishing the fatigue strength of the part. 2.

Context:  
① Ensure proper installation to prevent the development of additional stress and vibration. For critical components, avoid dents and scratches, as even the smallest damage could become a potential fracture point. ② Care should be taken to protect the equipment's operating environment, preventing erosion from corrosive media and avoiding excessive temperature differences between its various components. ③ To prevent equipment overload, strictly follow the equipment operating procedures. ④ Take timely corrective measures for parts with cracks.
6. Develop effective operating procedures, establish a sound equipment usage accountability system, and strictly adhere to them during operation. Establishing and adhering to operating procedures is one of the key measures to ensure the safe operation of equipment. Leaders at all levels within the enterprise, as well as equipment management departments, production team leaders, and production workers, all bear corresponding responsibilities in ensuring the proper use of equipment. Practical experience has shown that many equipment failures can be significantly reduced simply by following established operating procedures. 7. Pre-employment Training for Operators Operators must be thoroughly familiar with and proficient in the equipment’s performance, structure, processing capabilities, and maintenance procedures. New operators are required to undergo a technical assessment before operating the machine; only those who pass can independently perform setup tasks. For precision, complex, or critical production equipment, designated operators with specialized expertise should be assigned—adhering to the principle of ""designated personnel for specific machines, operating only with proper certification."" Additionally, employees should receive ongoing education and training on the proper use and care of equipment. The level of care operators demonstrate toward machinery directly impacts the equipment’s lifespan and operational efficiency. Therefore, companies must regularly provide employees with both ideological guidance and technical training, equipping them with the skills needed to diagnose and troubleshoot mechanical and electrical system failures effectively.
6 The procedure for equipment failure management is outlined below. (1) Conduct thorough education and awareness campaigns to ensure that operators and maintenance personnel voluntarily comply with relevant rules and regulations regarding operation, maintenance, inspection, etc., properly use and carefully maintain equipment, and diligently record, compile statistics, and analyze any equipment malfunctions. (2) Based on the company’s actual production conditions, equipment status, and specific features, determine the key areas for equipment failure management. (3) Use monitoring instruments and diagnostic techniques to systematically monitor critical equipment, enabling timely detection of fault indicators and deterioration. Information on equipment condition. Typically, equipment can undergo daily inspections, routine patrols, and periodic checks (including precision assessments), as well as integrity assessments—using human senses and common diagnostic tools—to closely monitor the technical status and any unusual signs in components, mechanisms, and areas prone to failure. At the same time, inspection standards should be established to clearly define the boundaries between normal operation, abnormalities, and equipment failures. (4) To quickly locate the fault location and its cause, in addition to providing training to ensure that maintenance and operational staff acquire a solid understanding of electrical and hydraulic technologies, it is also essential to compile common equipment failure symptoms, analysis procedures, and troubleshooting methods into a fault-finding logic flowchart. This will enable operators to swiftly identify the source and root cause of any malfunction after it occurs, allowing for timely diagnosis, repair, and restoration of equipment functionality. (5) Improve the fault recording system. Fault records serve as the foundational data for effective fault management and also provide the original basis for conducting fault analysis and troubleshooting. Records must be complete and accurate. After on-site inspections and fault repairs, maintenance personnel should follow the ""Equipment Carefully complete the ""Equipment Failure Repair Form"" and submit monthly statistical analyses to the equipment management department. (6) Conduct timely statistics and analysis of equipment failures. In addition to monitoring failure situations on a daily basis, staff members should compile ""Failure Repair Forms"" and maintenance records on a monthly basis. By systematically collecting, organizing, and analyzing failure data, it’s possible to calculate the failure frequency and mean time between failures for each type of equipment. Furthermore, this process allows for an in-depth analysis of individual equipment failure trends and identifies key root causes, helping to pinpoint recurring patterns. Armed with this insight, teams can prioritize their response strategies effectively. Finally, the compiled and analyzed failure information should be shared back with the planning department, enabling them to schedule preventive maintenance or implement improvement measures. This data can also serve as a valuable reference for adjusting the intervals, content, and standards of routine inspections. (7) Implement different countermeasures based on the nature of the failure, the type of fault, and the specific characteristics of the equipment. For newly acquired equipment, strengthen management during the initial phase of use—carefully monitor and document the equipment’s precision, performance, and any emerging defects from the outset. During operation, emphasize routine maintenance, regular patrol inspections, and periodic checks to promptly identify early warning signs and take appropriate adjustment or troubleshooting actions. For critical equipment, conduct condition monitoring and diagnostics. Establish a flexible and responsive maintenance team equipped with advanced technical expertise, employing rapid repair techniques such as component-by-component fixes or group-based replacements. Ensure timely availability of high-quality spare parts, leverage production downtime for equipment overhauls, and apply measures like retrofitting or replacing components when wear patterns have been thoroughly understood. (8) Carry out routine maintenance tasks effectively to control equipment failures. Utilize status information and early warning signs of potential issues gathered during daily rounds by regional maintenance workers, as well as scheduled equipment condition checks, along with relevant records and analysis data. Based on the specific characteristics of each type of equipment and the general defects already identified, the workshop’s equipment mechanic (technician) or maintenance team leader should promptly schedule routine repairs—ideally during production downtime or weekend slots—to proactively address problems before they escalate, thereby minimizing breakdowns. For certain failure indicators or hidden risks that exceed the scope of routine maintenance, these should be reported back to the planning department for scheduling dedicated, planned maintenance activities instead. (9) Establish a rational fault information management flowchart.
12 As a basis for determining equipment condition; it requires close collaboration between the design, manufacturing, and maintenance departments to develop a comprehensive maintenance plan for mechanical and electrical equipment, along with access to necessary testing methods and standards. 3. Targeted Maintenance System This maintenance system is based on comprehensive management principles and reliability-centered maintenance thinking, adopting a practical approach tailored to the specific characteristics of mechanical and electrical equipment—such as their design, performance, and operating conditions. Building upon the implementation of a condition-based inspection system, it strategically incorporates various maintenance methods, including predictive maintenance, preventive maintenance, and corrective maintenance. By leveraging advanced decision-making tools, computer technologies, as well as state monitoring and fault diagnosis techniques, the system ensures that maintenance activities are conducted in a scientifically sound manner. Ultimately, this approach aims to minimize the total lifecycle costs of equipment while maximizing overall operational efficiency and profitability. The characteristics of the targeted maintenance system are as follows: (1) It adopts and refines the classification management approach, strengthening maintenance management for key mechanical and electrical equipment as well as critical areas. Moreover, it implements tailored maintenance strategies based on the specific characteristics and current condition of each asset, maximizing their respective suitability and effectiveness to achieve optimal maintenance outcomes. (2) Among various maintenance approaches, condition monitoring and predictive maintenance should be promoted as the primary methods. Implement a systematic inspection system that embodies reliability-centered thinking, focusing maintenance efforts on routine upkeep while striving for targeted, proactive interventions whenever possible. (3) Emphasize the role of information, leverage computer technology for dynamic management, and make timely decisions to ensure that maintenance efforts are truly targeted and effective. The content of the targeted maintenance system includes: ① implementing a periodic inspection system, categorizing mechanical and electrical equipment, and applying various maintenance methods in a targeted manner; ② enhancing planned preventive maintenance by adopting maintenance type decisions for equipment equipped with condition-monitoring systems, allowing for tailored corrective or major overhauls; ③ establishing a set of maintenance and inspection standards, along with standardized work-hour quotas; ④ introducing computer-aided dynamic management, including decision-support systems for all relevant processes. 4. Operation and Maintenance System This is a standardized requirement for personnel behavior, serving as an essential software engineering practice in机电 equipment management, and it primarily consists of five disciplines and four key requirements. Five disciplines: ① Implement operator-specific machine assignments; ② Maintain cleanliness of mechanical and electrical equipment, ensuring proper lubrication and maintenance; ③ Follow safety operating procedures and the shift handover system; ④ Properly manage tools and accessories; ⑤ Immediately stop and inspect the machine upon detecting any malfunction. Four requirements: ① Neatness; ② Cleanliness; ③ Lubrication; ④ Safety.

When inspecting or approaching the equipment, they should avoid wearing loose-fitting clothing. Female employees are not permitted to wear long hair loose. (2) Before starting work, clear the workspace. Before turning on the equipment, inspect each operating handle and control device according to the items specified in the daily inspection checklist to ensure they are in the off position. Check whether any components show signs of severe wear, damage requiring replacement, or loose connections posing safety risks. Verify that all safety protection devices are intact and securely fastened. Also, confirm that the power supply is functioning properly and keep a detailed inspection record. If any issues are found that fail to meet safety standards, promptly submit safety improvement suggestions or solutions to the workshop supervisor to prevent the equipment from operating while faulty. (3) Check whether the wires and control cabinets are damaged, whether the surrounding environment is reliable, and whether the equipment's grounding or earthing facilities are safe. If any issues are detected, take protective measures immediately. (4) Check the oil quality and level in lubrication and hydraulic systems; replenish oil according to the lubrication chart, ensuring the oil remains clean, the oil lines are unobstructed, and lubrication is optimal. Proper lubrication not only guarantees effective cooling and heat dissipation but also provides sealing and protective functions. Additionally, it plays a significant role in cleaning away contaminants and reducing wear. (5) After confirming that all components are functioning correctly, you may first run the machine at low speed for 3–5 minutes with no load. Ensure that all parts operate smoothly and are well-lubricated before proceeding with actual work. Never exceed the recommended load or use the equipment outside of specified guidelines. (6) While the equipment is running, it is strictly prohibited to adjust the workpiece by hand or to perform lubrication, remove debris, or wipe down the machine. When leaving the machine tool, always turn off the power supply. During operation, closely monitor the condition of all components; if any abnormalities are detected, immediately stop the machine and address the issue. (7) When maintaining, servicing, or cleaning equipment and instruments, ensure that the equipment and instruments are powered down and the power supply is completely turned off. Additionally, clearly display or hang warning signs at the work site to indicate that the equipment is undergoing maintenance or repair, or that personnel are present for ongoing work. (8) Before maintenance and servicing, personnel should be aware of the precautions specific to this task and follow the proper maintenance procedures. During maintenance, staff must remain fully focused, wear appropriate safety gear, and ensure their standing position is secure. (9) When maintaining equipment, use disassembly tools correctly; unauthorized assembly or disassembly is strictly prohibited. Do not remove or alter the equipment's Safety protection device: When positioning or assembling the equipment, never insert your hands into the mating surfaces or use your fingers to align holes. (10) After completing maintenance, repair, and other operational tasks, equipment should be removed from the work area, and the workspace along with machinery must be thoroughly cleaned. Every component of the equipment’s instruments and gauges should be carefully inspected, ensuring that no tools or other items are left behind—either on the equipment or inside it. Additionally, the workshop should conduct regular maintenance, upkeep, and repairs to ensure the smooth operation of all machinery. (11) Instructions, safety signs, and signage located within the workshop and on machinery must be strictly followed at all times. (12) It is strictly prohibited to use flammable or volatile substances for wiping equipment. Oil-soaked rags must not be left on the equipment, and no flammable or explosive materials are allowed to be stored near the equipment. (13) When working in flammable and explosive hazard areas, appropriate safety measures must be taken beforehand and approved by the production safety department and management before proceeding. Additionally, when welding or grinding containers or pipelines containing flammable, explosive, or toxic materials, these must first be properly purged and thoroughly cleaned—and all openings must be fully opened—before work can begin. (14) The work area should be dry and clean. Used oil and waste rags must not be discarded randomly on the floor. Raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished goods must be neatly stacked, and blocking passageways is strictly prohibited. (15) Regularly maintain the cleanliness of lubrication and hydraulic systems. Keep the tank lid securely closed, ensuring no water, dust, metal chips, or other contaminants enter the oil tank or electrical equipment. (16) After finishing work and before leaving for the day, clean the machine tools and equipment thoroughly, ensuring they remain tidy. Return operating handles, buttons, and other controls to their non-working positions, turn off the power supply, and complete the handover procedures with the next shift. 3) Classification of Maintenance and Servicing Tasks Depending on the depth, scope, and volume of work involved in equipment maintenance and upkeep, maintenance tasks can be categorized into the following types. (1) Daily Maintenance (Routine Maintenance). Its main tasks include: inspecting and lubricating the equipment; strictly following the equipment operation procedures.

Cultivate a culture and habit of consciously caring for equipment, ensuring it remains regularly clean, safe, and in optimal technical condition. 1.2.5 Maintenance and保养 of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment 1) Principles of Operation and Maintenance Procedures Mechanical and electrical equipment maintenance refers to the tasks performed to eliminate inevitable abnormal technical conditions that arise during operation (such as loose parts, dry friction, or unusual noises). Overall, maintaining mechanical and electrical equipment requires meeting four fundamental criteria: neatness, cleanliness, lubrication, and safety. Developing clear equipment operation and maintenance procedures is a crucial step in ensuring that all subsequent operations are carried out systematically and efficiently. The principles for creating these operational and maintenance guidelines are outlined below. (1) General guidelines should list precautions according to the equipment operation sequence, as well as before, during, and after shifts—aiming for concise, clear, and practical content. (2) List the structural features, processing range, operational precautions, maintenance requirements, and more separately by equipment category, making it easier for operators to grasp the key points and ensure proper implementation. (3) Common elements across various types of mechanical and electrical equipment can be used to develop a unified, standard general procedure. (4) Key equipment, high-precision, large and medium-sized, as well as rare and critical electromechanical devices, must have operation and maintenance procedures prepared separately. Also, post prominent signage near the machine tool, clearly indicating that operators should pay special attention and strictly adhere to the guidelines. 2) Basic Content of Operation and Maintenance Procedures
The basic content of operation and maintenance procedures generally includes the following aspects. (1) Operators must wear appropriate personal protective equipment as required during operation. When inspecting or approaching the equipment, they should avoid wearing loose-fitting clothing. Female employees are not permitted to wear long hair loose. (2) Before starting work, clear the workspace. Before turning on the equipment, inspect each operating handle and control device according to the items specified in the daily inspection checklist to ensure they are in the off position. Check whether any components show signs of severe wear, damage requiring replacement, or loose connections posing safety risks. Verify that all safety protection devices are intact and securely fastened. Also, confirm that the power supply is functioning properly and keep a detailed inspection record. If any issues are found that fail to meet safety standards, promptly submit safety improvement suggestions or solutions to the workshop supervisor to prevent the equipment from operating while faulty. (3) Check whether the wires and control cabinets are damaged, whether the surrounding environment is reliable, and whether the equipment's grounding or earthing facilities are safe. If any issues are detected, take protective measures immediately. (4) Check the oil quality and level in lubrication and hydraulic systems; replenish oil according to the lubrication chart, ensuring the oil remains clean, the oil lines are unobstructed, and lubrication is optimal. Proper lubrication not only guarantees effective cooling and heat dissipation but also provides sealing and protective functions. Additionally, it plays a significant role in cleaning away contaminants and reducing wear. (5) After confirming that all components are functioning correctly, you may first run the machine at low speed for 3–5 minutes with no load. Ensure that all parts operate smoothly and are well-lubricated before proceeding with actual work. Never exceed the recommended load or use the equipment outside of specified guidelines. (6) While the equipment is running, it is strictly prohibited to adjust the workpiece by hand or to perform lubrication, remove debris, or wipe down the machine. When leaving the machine tool, always turn off the power supply. During operation, closely monitor the condition of all components; if any abnormalities are detected, immediately stop the machine and address the issue. (7) When maintaining, servicing, or cleaning equipment and instruments, ensure that the equipment and instruments are powered down and the power supply is completely turned off. Additionally, clearly display or hang warning signs at the work site to indicate that the equipment is undergoing maintenance or repair, or that personnel are present for ongoing work. (8) Before maintenance and servicing, personnel should be aware of the precautions specific to this task and follow the proper maintenance procedures. During maintenance, staff must remain fully focused, wear appropriate safety gear, and ensure their standing position is secure. (9) When maintaining equipment, use disassembly tools correctly; unauthorized assembly or disassembly is strictly prohibited. Do not remove or alter the equipment's Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance at will. Safety protection device: When positioning or assembling the equipment, never insert your hands into the mating surfaces or use your fingers to align holes. (10) After completing maintenance, repair, and other operational tasks, equipment should be removed from the work area, and the workspace along with machinery must be thoroughly cleaned. Every component of the equipment’s instruments and gauges should be carefully inspected, ensuring that no tools or other items are left behind—either on the equipment or inside it. Additionally, the workshop should conduct regular maintenance, upkeep, and repairs to ensure the smooth operation of all machinery. (11) Instructions, safety signs, and signage located within the workshop and on machinery must be strictly followed at all times. (12) It is strictly prohibited to use flammable or volatile substances for wiping equipment. Oil-soaked rags must not be left on the equipment, and no flammable or explosive materials are allowed to be stored near the equipment. (13) When working in flammable and explosive hazard areas, appropriate safety measures must be taken beforehand and approved by the production safety department and management before proceeding. Additionally, when welding or grinding containers or pipelines containing flammable, explosive, or toxic materials, these must first be properly purged and thoroughly cleaned—and all openings must be fully opened—before work can begin. (14) The work area should be dry and clean. Used oil and waste rags must not be discarded randomly on the floor. Raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished goods must be neatly stacked, and blocking passageways is strictly prohibited. (15) Regularly maintain the cleanliness of lubrication and hydraulic systems. Keep the tank lid securely closed, ensuring no water, dust, metal chips, or other contaminants enter the oil tank or electrical equipment. (16) After finishing work and before leaving for the day, clean the machine tools and equipment thoroughly, ensuring they remain tidy. Return operating handles, buttons, and other controls to their non-working positions, turn off the power supply, and complete the handover procedures with the next shift. 3) Classification of Maintenance and Servicing Tasks Depending on the depth, scope, and volume of work involved in equipment maintenance and upkeep, maintenance tasks can be categorized into the following types.

6) Use correctly Under normal operating conditions, mechanical equipment follows its own failure patterns; however, when operating conditions change, these failure patterns also shift accordingly. The primary operating conditions include the following: (1) Load. The primary causes of wear and fatigue failure in mechanical equipment are the wear of components and their fatigue-induced damage. Under specified operating conditions, the rate of component wear over a given period is directly proportional to the magnitude of the load applied. Meanwhile, fatigue damage to components occurs only under certain types of cyclic loading and intensifies as the load increases. Thus, both wear and fatigue are functions of the applied load. Exceeding the design-rated load levels can lead to severe failure, which is unacceptable. (2) Environment. The environment includes the effects of climate, corrosive media, and other harmful substances, as well as the condition of the working object itself. Increased temperatures accelerate wear and corrosion, while excessively high humidity and corrosive agents present in the air can lead to both corrosion and corrosive wear. Additionally, excessive dust levels in the air and harsh operating conditions often contribute to equipment failures. However, the environment is an objective factor, and in certain situations, measures can be taken manually to improve it. (3) Maintenance and Operation. Establishing a sound maintenance system and strictly adhering to technical maintenance guidelines and operational procedures are crucial for ensuring the reliable performance of mechanical equipment and extending its service life. Additionally, it is essential to provide training for personnel to enhance their skills and expertise.

1.2.4 Use of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment During operation, equipment's technical condition changes—and its performance gradually declines—due to various forces acting upon it, as well as factors such as environmental conditions, usage methods, operational guidelines, and the duration of use. To effectively manage these changes in technical condition and slow down the decline in equipment performance, the most critical measure is to ensure the equipment is used properly and correctly. Maintenance of mechanical and electrical equipment is a crucial method for improving utilization and ensuring its functionality—it consists of two forms: daily maintenance and periodic maintenance. Daily maintenance is primarily carried out by operators of mechanical and electrical equipment—conducting pre-shift inspections and post-shift cleaning to ensure that the equipment remains in optimal technical condition. Regular maintenance, also known as Level 1 care, is carried out by operators with assistance from maintenance personnel. It’s similar to minor repairs and is covered in Chapter 1 of the ""Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance."" It varies depending on the type of mechanical and electrical equipment.

1.2 Basics of Equipment Maintenance 1.2.1 Maintenance Method The method of equipment maintenance carries the meaning of a maintenance strategy. Modern equipment management emphasizes applying different maintenance approaches to various types of equipment, underscoring that equipment repair should align with the objective principles governing the physical lifecycle of machinery and materials. This approach ensures production continuity while optimizing the efficient use of maintenance resources, ultimately achieving the most cost-effective outcome over the equipment's entire lifespan. Commonly used maintenance methods for electromechanical equipment include the following: Reactive Maintenance Post-failure maintenance, also known as breakdown maintenance, damage repair, or unplanned maintenance, refers to repairs carried out after mechanical and electrical equipment has malfunctioned—essentially, ""if it breaks, we fix it."" For certain critical equipment, post-failure maintenance should be minimized whenever possible; however, for devices that have minimal impact on production or are backed up by redundant units, opting for post-failure maintenance is often the most cost-effective approach. Preventive Maintenance Maintenance performed before mechanical and electrical equipment fails is called preventive maintenance. Its main benefits include reducing unexpected equipment failures, ensuring continuous production, integrating equipment upkeep and repair tasks into a structured plan—thereby minimizing unplanned disruptions in production—and ultimately improving equipment utilization, lowering maintenance costs, and extending the equipment's natural lifespan. Preventive maintenance is categorized into two basic forms: Regular maintenance Regular maintenance is also known as planned maintenance or time-based preventive maintenance. It involves carrying out preventive maintenance activities at predetermined intervals and follows a cyclical pattern. This type of maintenance is based on the wear patterns of components, with specific guidelines for setting maintenance intervals, defining maintenance categories, outlining maintenance tasks, and estimating the associated workload. However, this approach to maintenance can lead to certain challenges: First, when equipment is still in good technical condition and fully capable of continuing operation, it may undergo major over-maintenance simply because the scheduled interval has arrived—resulting in unnecessary repairs. Second, if a machine’s technical condition has already deteriorated to the point where it can no longer meet production requirements, but the prescribed maintenance interval hasn’t yet been reached, no repair plan will be implemented, leading to under-maintenance. This method is particularly well-suited for process-oriented production equipment or power systems where the wear patterns are well understood, and operations are stable and continuous—such as large-scale assembly line equipment or key machinery operating on automated production lines. Currently, China primarily implements two main types of equipment maintenance systems: the Planned Preventive Maintenance System and the Planned Warranty System. (1) Planned Preventive Maintenance System (referred to as Planned Pre-Maintenance). This system involves maintaining, inspecting, and repairing equipment according to its wear patterns, adhering to predetermined maintenance cycles and procedures, to ensure that the equipment consistently remains in optimal technical condition. Its key features are outlined below. ① Perform daily cleaning, inspection, lubrication, tightening, and adjustments on equipment as required to minimize wear and ensure proper operation. ② Conduct regular inspections and adjustments of the equipment's operational status and wear levels according to the prescribed schedule, ensuring that potential issues are promptly addressed. This allows you to monitor changes in the equipment's technical condition and adequately prepare the necessary resources for scheduled maintenance. ③ Conduct preventive maintenance on equipment in a planned and prepared manner. (2) The Planned Maintenance System (also known as the Maintenance and Repair System) is a equipment maintenance approach that combines routine upkeep with scheduled inspections and repairs. Its key features are outlined below. ① Based on the equipment's characteristics and condition, different maintenance categories and intervals are specified according to operational hours (such as production output and mileage)."

Context:  
The basic content of operation and maintenance procedures generally includes the following aspects. (1) Operators must wear appropriate personal protective equipment as required during operation. When inspecting or approaching the equipment, they should avoid wearing loose-fitting clothing. Female employees are not permitted to wear long hair loose. (2) Before starting work, clear the workspace. Before turning on the equipment, inspect each operating handle and control device according to the items specified in the daily inspection checklist to ensure they are in the off position. Check whether any components show signs of severe wear, damage requiring replacement, or loose connections posing safety risks. Verify that all safety protection devices are intact and securely fastened. Also, confirm that the power supply is functioning properly and keep a detailed inspection record. If any issues are found that fail to meet safety standards, promptly submit safety improvement suggestions or solutions to the workshop supervisor to prevent the equipment from operating while faulty. (3) Check whether the wires and control cabinets are damaged, whether the surrounding environment is reliable, and whether the equipment's grounding or earthing facilities are safe. If any issues are detected, take protective measures immediately. (4) Check the oil quality and level in lubrication and hydraulic systems; replenish oil according to the lubrication chart, ensuring the oil remains clean, the oil lines are unobstructed, and lubrication is optimal. Proper lubrication not only guarantees effective cooling and heat dissipation but also provides sealing and protective functions. Additionally, it plays a significant role in cleaning away contaminants and reducing wear. (5) After confirming that all components are functioning correctly, you may first run the machine at low speed for 3–5 minutes with no load. Ensure that all parts operate smoothly and are well-lubricated before proceeding with actual work. Never exceed the recommended load or use the equipment outside of specified guidelines. (6) While the equipment is running, it is strictly prohibited to adjust the workpiece by hand or to perform lubrication, remove debris, or wipe down the machine. When leaving the machine tool, always turn off the power supply. During operation, closely monitor the condition of all components; if any abnormalities are detected, immediately stop the machine and address the issue. (7) When maintaining, servicing, or cleaning equipment and instruments, ensure that the equipment and instruments are powered down and the power supply is completely turned off. Additionally, clearly display or hang warning signs at the work site to indicate that the equipment is undergoing maintenance or repair, or that personnel are present for ongoing work. (8) Before maintenance and servicing, personnel should be aware of the precautions specific to this task and follow the proper maintenance procedures. During maintenance, staff must remain fully focused, wear appropriate safety gear, and ensure their standing position is secure. (9) When maintaining equipment, use disassembly tools correctly; unauthorized assembly or disassembly is strictly prohibited. Do not remove or alter the equipment's Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance at will. 15 Safety protection device: When positioning or assembling the equipment, never insert your hands into the mating surfaces or use your fingers to align holes. (10) After completing maintenance, repair, and other operational tasks, equipment should be removed from the work area, and the workspace along with machinery must be thoroughly cleaned. Every component of the equipment’s instruments and gauges should be carefully inspected, ensuring that no tools or other items are left behind—either on the equipment or inside it. Additionally, the workshop should conduct regular maintenance, upkeep, and repairs to ensure the smooth operation of all machinery. (11) Instructions, safety signs, and signage located within the workshop and on machinery must be strictly followed at all times. (12) It is strictly prohibited to use flammable or volatile substances for wiping equipment. Oil-soaked rags must not be left on the equipment, and no flammable or explosive materials are allowed to be stored near the equipment. (13) When working in flammable and explosive hazard areas, appropriate safety measures must be taken beforehand and approved by the production safety department and management before proceeding. Additionally, when welding or grinding containers or pipelines containing flammable, explosive, or toxic materials, these must first be properly purged and thoroughly cleaned—and all openings must be fully opened—before work can begin. (14) The work area should be dry and clean. Used oil and waste rags must not be discarded randomly on the floor. Raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished goods must be neatly stacked, and blocking passageways is strictly prohibited. (15) Regularly maintain the cleanliness of lubrication and hydraulic systems. Keep the tank lid securely closed, ensuring no water, dust, metal chips, or other contaminants enter the oil tank or electrical equipment. (16) After finishing work and before leaving for the day, clean the machine tools and equipment thoroughly, ensuring they remain tidy. Return operating handles, buttons, and other controls to their non-working positions, turn off the power supply, and complete the handover procedures with the next shift."

What precautions should be taken when using mechanical and electrical equipment? What are the three aspects covered in equipment fault diagnosis? And how can the specific implementation process be summarized into four key steps? What are the specific measures to prevent or reduce wear?
Based on the assessment of the equipment's current status, determine the appropriate responses and actions to take. At the same time, forecast how the equipment's condition may evolve based on existing signals, and conduct a trend analysis to anticipate future developments. The above four steps form a cycle; often, a complex or challenging fault cannot be correctly identified in just one cycle. Instead, it requires multiple iterations of the diagnostic process (as shown in Figure 1.1), gradually deepening both your understanding and the accuracy of your assessments—only then can the issue ultimately be resolved. Figure 1.1: Fault Diagnosis Process
16 1. Equipment Fault Diagnosis Process Equipment fault diagnosis encompasses three key areas: condition monitoring, analytical diagnosis, and fault prediction. The specific implementation process can be summarized into the following four steps. 1) Signal Acquisition During operation, equipment inevitably experiences changes in various quantities such as force, heat, vibration, and energy, generating a wide range of distinct information. Depending on specific diagnostic needs, it is crucial to select signals that accurately reflect the equipment's operational status—such as vibration, pressure, or temperature—since these signals are typically captured using different types of sensors. 2) Signal Processing This is the process of classifying and processing the collected signals to extract features that accurately represent the machine's characteristics—also known as feature extraction. For example, transforming a vibration signal from the time domain to the frequency domain for spectral analysis is part of this process. 3) State Recognition The device's characteristic parameters, obtained after signal processing, are compared with the specified allowable or discriminant parameters to determine the device's condition. The current status—whether a fault exists, and if so, its type and nature. To address this, appropriate identification criteria and diagnostic strategies should be carefully developed. 4) Diagnostic Decision-making
1) Verify the fault symptoms or signs Given the complexity and subtlety of hydraulic system failures, it is essential to first verify the specific symptoms or signs of the malfunction. This can be done by asking operators and maintenance personnel about recent changes in the machine’s performance, its maintenance history, any specific actions taken after the initial failure signs appeared, and the components that have already been inspected and adjusted. 2) Identify fault diagnosis parameters Hydraulic system failures are all classified as parameter-based faults, and useful fault information is extracted by measuring relevant parameters. Diagnostic parameters for hydraulic systems include system pressure, system flow rate, component temperature rise, component leakage, system vibration and noise, as well as motor speed. When selecting diagnostic parameters, the following principles should be followed: the parameters must exhibit high sensitivity, ease of measurement, and good reproducibility, while also being capable of capturing as much fault-related information as possible. 3) Analyze and determine the possible location and extent of the fault. Analyze the detected results by referring to the hydraulic system schematic, examining both the structural and system principles to ensure accurate fault diagnosis and minimize misdiagnoses. 4) Develop a rational diagnostic process and diagnostic methods Select instruments and meters for diagnostic use The diagnostic instruments and equipment include photoelectric digital tachometers, thermometers, stopwatches, pressure gauges, hydraulic testers, various types of connectors, specialized tools, and more. The selection principle is as follows: First, choose instruments that do not require any disassembly of system components; second, opt for instruments that need to be connected directly into the system; and finally, use hydraulic measuring devices. In cases where the fault is particularly complex, a hydraulic tester can also be used initially for diagnosis. It’s crucial to note that before analyzing and identifying the exact location and extent of the failure, absolutely avoid any unnecessary disassembly, dismantling, or unauthorized adjustments of hydraulic components. Doing so could inadvertently worsen the problem, introduce new issues, or even complicate the original fault further.

First, check the speed to see if there are any changes or abnormalities in the movement of the actuator. Second, check the pressure—this refers to the magnitude and changes in pressure at each monitoring point within the hydraulic system. Third, inspect the fluid: Examine the color of the hydraulic oil to assess its level of contamination. Typically, this is done by pouring the working oil into a transparent glass bottle and letting it sit undisturbed for 1 hour before observing. If the hydraulic oil remains clear, transparent, and colorless, it indicates that the oil is free from contamination. If the oil appears cloudy and white, with clarity at the top of the bottle and turbidity at the bottom, it suggests that water has entered and contaminated the oil. Conversely, if the oil is clear at the bottom but cloudy at the top, air has likely mixed in, causing contamination. If the oil turns a mottled, unevenly cloudy reddish-brown hue, it means iron rust and sediment have contaminated the fluid. A deep red or tea-brown color signals that the oil has degraded due to high temperatures and oxidation. If the oil remains transparent but has faded in color, it suggests that an incompatible type of oil has been mixed in—but as long as the viscosity still meets specifications, the oil can still be used. Finally, check whether there’s foam on the oil’s surface, ensure the oil level stays within the prescribed markings on the dipstick, and verify that the oil’s viscosity aligns with  the required standards. Check whether the oil temperature gauge is within the optimal range of 30–50°C, and whether it exceeds the permissible limit set for the specified temperat ure. Also, perform a  ""fourth check "" for leaks—inspect all connection points for any signs of seepage or leakage. Five checks for vibration refer to whether the hydraulic actuator exhibits any bouncing or jerking du ring operation. Sixth, examine the product: Assess the working condition of the actuator, as well as the stability of the hydraulic system's working pressure and flow rate, based o n the quality of the products produced by the hydraulic equipment. First, check the fuel tank to ensure the fluid level meets the required specifications. Observe whether the hydra ulic pump's suction action causes fluctuations in the tank’s liquid level, potentially leading to the suction pipe and filter briefly exposing above the fluid surface. Also, inspec t the tank and return line for any presence of air bubbles. (2) Listen. Normal equipment operation produces sounds with a certain melody and rhythm, maintaining consistent stabilit y. Therefore, from a practical standpoint… By accumulating, familiarizing yourself with, and mastering these natural rhythms and tempos, you'll be able to accurately determine whet her hydraulic equipment is operating properly—and simultaneously, based on…"

4. Logical Diagnostic Method The logical diagnostic method involves dividing the  system into multiple functional units for analysis, gradually narrowing down to the specific area where the fault occurs, ultimately identifying the root cause of the problem, and  then proceeding with repairs. This method leverages the unique characteristics of hydraulic systems to systematically analyze and diagnose the issue at hand. Edit relationships, sy stem parameters, and the system's distribution structure to control the source.
1. Sensory Diagnostic Method Sensory diagnosis, also known as preliminary diagnosis, is one of the simplest and most convenient methods for troubleshooting hydraulic systems. This approach relies on the mnemonic ""look, listen, touch, smell, read, ask."" The visual inspection method can be carried out either while the hydraulic equipment is in operation or when it’s idle. (1) Look. Observe the actual operation of the hydraulic system.
Modern mechanical manufacturing systems are characterized by  their large-scale control, high levels of automation, and strong flexibility. As the structure of these manufacturing systems becomes increasingly complex, demands for cost control  and production continuity continue to rise—making any downtime caused by various types of failures an unacceptable burden. Consequently, fault diagnosis systems have seen rapid ad vancements, with technologies now including the use of advanced sensors to capture diverse physical parameters during processes, enabling seamless signal transmission and processin g. By analyzing these processed signals, operators can monitor the operational status of production equipment and assess product quality in real time, while also predicting future  trends, diagnosing faults, and triggering timely alerts. Currently, fault analysis methods used in mechanical production systems can be applied to automated production lines, CNC machine tools, flexible manufacturing cells, and even larger systems such as computer-integrated manufacturing systems. Automated production lines are far more complex than individual pieces of equipment, making it challenging to quickly pinpoint the root cause and exact location of a problem. To enhance overall system efficiency, in addition to improving equipment reliability, it is often essential—under certain conditions—to introduce advanced fault diagnosis systems into automated production lines. 1. Errors Introduced by the Sensor Sensor-generated errors can be categorized into five basic types: insertion error, application error, characteristic error, and dynamic error. Chapter 5: Fault Diagnosis and Repair of Electrical Systems 163 Difference and environmental error. (1) Insertion error. It occurs when a sensor is inserted into the system, causing errors due to changes in the measured parameters. This kind of issue typically arises during electronic measurements, but similar problems can also occur in other types of measurements. (2) Application error. This is caused by the operator and can arise from various factors. For instance, it may occur during temperature measurements. Errors include incorrect probe placement or improper insulation between the probe and the measurement point. Additionally, some application errors arise during the purification process of air or other gases. Application errors also involve misplacement of the transmitter, which can lead to inaccurate readings due to either positive or negative pressure affecting the measurement. (3) Characteristic error. This is inherent to the device itself and represents the discrepancy between the device’s ideal, well-established transfer function characteristics and its actual performance. Such errors include DC drift values (e.g., incorrect pressure head). (4) Dynamic Error. Many sensors exhibit strong damping, which prevents them from responding quickly to changes in input parameters. For instance, a thermistor may take several seconds to react to a step change in temperature, meaning it won’t instantly jump to a new impedance or produce an abrupt shift. Instead, it gradually adjusts to the new value over time. If a sensor with inherent delay characteristics attempts to respond rapidly to a sudden temperature change, the resulting output waveform will become distorted, as it will include dynamic error. Factors contributing to dynamic error include response time, amplitude distortion, and phase distortion. (5) Environmental errors. These arise from the environment in which the sensor is used and include factors such as temperature, sway, vibration, altitude, chemical vaporization, or other influences. Such factors often affect the sensor's performance, which is why, in practical applications, they are typically categorized and addressed collectively."

The collected fault signals need to be stored and documented. Regular or online monitoring in equipment condition monitoring also falls under the category of simplified diagnostic techniques. It primarily involves checking specific parameters that reflect the equipment's technical condition to determine whether everything is functioning properly. If any abnormalities are detected or if parameters exceed predefined limits, the equipment should automatically trigger an alarm or shut down. However, condition monitoring differs from identifying and diagnosing actual faults. The simplified diagnostic method is suitable for the installation and commissioning phase, used to inspect and eliminate defects caused during transportation and installation work. It is also applicable during the maintenance phase for condition monitoring, enabling early detection of potential hazards and providing insights into the equipment's degradation trends. 2) Precision Diagnostic Technology Precision diagnostic technology uses sophisticated instruments and methods to provide a detailed evaluation of equipment that is difficult to diagnose accurately with simpler techniques. It typically includes: (1) Utilize a variety of sophisticated diagnostic analysis instruments or specialized diagnostic equipment. (2) Conducted on-site at the production facility and in the diagnostic center by experienced engineering technicians and experts. (3) Identify the location of equipment failures, determine their root causes, and perform a quantitative diagnosis of the failure types. (4) The technical knowledge and work experience involved are relatively complex, requiring collaboration across multiple disciplines. (5) Perform advanced signal processing and, if necessary, predict equipment lifespan. Precision diagnostic technologies are used not only in the development and design of equipment but, increasingly, during the operation and maintenance phases. For devices that have already undergone preliminary diagnostics and been identified as exhibiting anomalies or malfunctions, these advanced techniques further pinpoint the specific locations, root causes, and types of failures—enabling more accurate and targeted repairs. It facilitates making repair decisions. Since it involves higher costs, it’s typically used in advance only when a simple diagnosis fails to provide a clear answer.
Equipment Fault Diagnosis Levels Equipment fault diagnosis is generally divided into two levels: simple diagnosis and precision diagnosis. Most equipment faults can be identified using simple diagnostic techniques, making this approach the foundation of diagnostic work. Precision diagnostic techniques are only employed when simple diagnostics fail to pinpoint the issue. Simple Diagnostic Technique Simple diagnostic techniques involve using straightforward instruments and methods to quickly provide a general assessment of equipment condition. Technique, which generally includes: (1) Use a variety of simple and portable diagnostic instruments and testing devices.
6 The procedure for equipment failure management is outlined below. (1) Conduct thorough education and awareness campaigns to ensure that operators and maintenance personnel voluntarily comply with relevant rules and regulations regarding operation, maintenance, inspection, etc., properly use and carefully maintain equipment, and diligently record, compile statistics, and analyze any equipment malfunctions. (2) Based on the company’s actual production conditions, equipment status, and specific features, determine the key areas for equipment failure management. (3) Use monitoring instruments and diagnostic techniques to systematically monitor critical equipment, enabling timely detection of fault indicators and deterioration. Information on equipment condition. Typically, equipment can undergo daily inspections, routine patrols, and periodic checks (including precision assessments), as well as integrity assessments—using human senses and common diagnostic tools—to closely monitor the technical status and any unusual signs in components, mechanisms, and areas prone to failure. At the same time, inspection standards should be established to clearly define the boundaries between normal operation, abnormalities, and equipment failures. (4) To quickly locate the fault location and its cause, in addition to providing training to ensure that maintenance and operational staff acquire a solid understanding of electrical and hydraulic technologies, it is also essential to compile common equipment failure symptoms, analysis procedures, and troubleshooting methods into a fault-finding logic flowchart. This will enable operators to swiftly identify the source and root cause of any malfunction after it occurs, allowing for timely diagnosis, repair, and restoration of equipment functionality. (5) Improve the fault recording system. Fault records serve as the foundational data for effective fault management and also provide the original basis for conducting fault analysis and troubleshooting. Records must be complete and accurate. After on-site inspections and fault repairs, maintenance personnel should follow the ""Equipment Carefully complete the  ""Equipment Failure Repair Form "" and submit monthly statistical analyses to the equipment management department. (6) Conduct timely statistics and analysis of equipment failures. In addition to monitoring failur e situations on a daily basis, staff members should compile  ""Failure Repair Forms "" and maintenance records on a monthly basis. By systematically collecting, organizing, and analyzing failure data, it’s possible to calculate the failure frequency and mean time b etween failures for each type of equipment. Furthermore, this process allows for an in-depth analysis of individual equipment failure trends and identifies key root causes, helping  to pinpoint recurring patterns. Armed with this insight, teams can prioritize their response strategies effectively. Finally, the compiled and analyzed failure information should  be shared back with the planning department, enabling them to schedule preventive maintenance or implement improvement measures. This data can also serve as a valuable reference fo r adjusting the intervals, content, and standards of routine inspections. (7) Implement different countermeasures based on the nature of the failure, the type of fault, and the spe cific characteristics of the equipment. For newly acquired equipment, strengthen management during the initial phase of use—carefully monitor and document the equipment’s precision , performance, and any emerging defects from the outset. During operation, emphasize routine maintenance, regular patrol inspections, and periodic checks to promptly identify early  warning signs and take appropriate adjustment or troubleshooting actions. For critical equipment, conduct condition monitoring and diagnostics. Establish a flexible and responsive  maintenance team equipped with advanced technical expertise, employing rapid repair techniques such as component-by-component fixes or group-based replacements. Ensure timely avai lability of high-quality spare parts, leverage production downtime for equipment overhauls, and apply measures like retrofitting or replacing components when wear patterns have bee n thoroughly understood. (8) Carry out routine maintenance tasks effectively to control equipment failures. Utilize status information and early warning signs of potential issues g athered during daily rounds by regional maintenance workers, as well as scheduled equipment condition checks, along with relevant records and analysis data. Based on the specific c haracteristics of each type of equipment and the general defects already identified, the workshop’s equipment mechanic (technician) or maintenance team leader should promptly sched ule routine repairs—ideally during production downtime or weekend slots—to proactively address problems before they escalate, thereby minimizing breakdowns. For certain failure ind icators or hidden risks that exceed the scope of routine maintenance, these should be reported back to the planning department for scheduling dedicated, planned maintenance activit ies instead. (9) Establish a rational fault information management flowchart.
The degree is very high. Choose a reasonable running-in load, relative motion speed, and lubrication. Slip conditions and other parameters are key to shortening the break-in period. 2) Stable Wear Phase AB The wear characteristic of this stage is a low and stable wear rate, which is why the duration of this phase is relatively long. But by mid- Figure 1.3: Wear Characteristic Curve –  Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance 19 Later on, the wear rate becomes relatively faster, but the equipment can still fu nction for a while. When the wear amount reaches point B, the wear rate sharply accelerates, marking the onset of the severe wear phase. Proper usage, along with regular maintenanc e and upkeep of the equipment, is key to extending this critical stage. 3) Rapid Wear Phase BC Once this stage is reached, significant changes in friction conditions occur, such as  altered lubrication or shifts in the geometric dimensions of components. Changes, such as increased clearance between mating parts and the generation of impact loads, can cause we ar rates to rise sharply. At this point, mechanical efficiency noticeably declines, and precision deteriorates—conditions that, if left unaddressed, could lead to equipment failure  or even unexpected accidents. Therefore, promptly identifying and repairing components that are about to enter this stage is critically important. According to wear results, wear  is categorized into pitting wear, adhesive wear, abrasive wear, and more; while based on wear mechanisms, it is classified into abrasive wear, fatigue wear, adhesive wear, fretting  wear, and others. Abrasive wear occurs when a hard protruding part on one surface of a friction pair comes into contact with the other surface, or when abrasive particles are pres ent between the two rubbing surfaces. Wear occurs when hard particulates—such as dust in the air or metal particles generated by abrasion—cause material transfer from one surface t o another, or even simultaneous material loss on both surfaces, during relative motion. Among the many wear failure modes, abrasive wear is not only the most common but also the mo st severe type of failure. Fretting wear refers to a type of wear where localized areas on the surfaces of friction pairs develop fatigue cracks under cyclic contact stresses, lead ing to the detachment of micro-sheets or particles. Depending on the nature of contact and relative motion between the friction pairs, fretting wear can be categorized into two mai n forms: rolling-contact fatigue wear and sliding-contact fatigue wear. In practical applications, pure rolling-contact fatigue wear is relatively rare; most often, it occurs as a  combination of rolling and sliding motions. Adhesive wear occurs when, at the points of contact between mating surfaces,  ""cold welding "" takes place, causing material from one surface to transfer to the other during relative sliding. Micro-motion wear is a type of wear that occurs when two contacting objects under go relative vibrations with very small amplitudes. It happens on two closely matched surfaces that appear nominally stationary but actually experience cyclic, minute-scale relative  sliding—typically at the micrometer level (2–20 μm). For instance, this phenomenon can be observed at interference or transition-fit interfaces between shafts and holes, on keyway  surfaces, or in threaded fasteners. Wear occurring on working surfaces, such as the working surface of the rivet, and other similar areas. Fretting wear not only reduces mating ac curacy, loosens tight-fitting components, and degrades the quality of the mating surfaces, but can also lead to the formation of fatigue cracks, significantly diminishing the fatig ue strength of the part. 2. Measures to Prevent or Reduce Wear
Transmission system diagram, hydraulic system diagram, electrical systems and wiring diagrams, rolling bearing location maps, and lubrication system diagrams, among others. (2) Assembly drawings. Manufacturers typically do not provide complete assembly drawings for components, subassemblies, and the finished machine. Whenever possible, you should gather these drawings or, during equipment maintenance, create detailed sketches of critical components or the entire machine. (3) Spare parts, wear-and-tear component drawings and bills of materials, along with a list of purchased components. (4) Other content. For power equipment, as-built drawings, piping or wiring network diagrams, and similar documents should also be provided. 3) Maintenance Technical Preparation Work Technical preparation work before equipment maintenance is also an important foundational task, primarily involving a pre-maintenance technical condition assessment and the preparation of maintenance-related technical documents. 2. Standardization of Maintenance Procedures To ensure repair quality, enhance repair efficiency, and prevent resource waste, it is necessary to standardize the various procedural practices involved in the repair process. 1) Maintenance Procedures (1) Typical maintenance procedures. A typical maintenance procedure refers to the repair process developed for common wear-and-tear scenarios affecting parts of a specific equipment type and structural design—parts that are identical across such equipment. While these procedures offer broad guidance, they often lack specificity when applied to a particular piece of equipment. (2) Dedicated maintenance procedures. Dedicated maintenance procedures refer to processes specifically developed by a company for a particular model of equipment, tailored to address its actual wear-and-tear conditions. Moreover, the maintenance procedure prepared for a specific repair of this equipment still holds significant reference value for future repairs and should be adjusted and updated as needed, based on actual wear conditions and technological advancements."

The material condition and characteristics. 1.1.3 Characteristics of the Failure Diversity Various pieces of equipment not only differ in structure and process parameters, but also vary in their manufacturing, installation processes, and operating environments—leading to a wide range of potential failures during operation. Hierarchical Structure Once a device exhibits a certain failure symptom, it becomes necessary to investigate the root cause of the malfunction. However, some failure causes are often deeply rooted—meaning that a higher-level failure stems from a lower-level one, creating a hierarchical pattern. Multifactorial and Correlation The components of the equipment—and even individual devices—are interconnected through mechanical structures or material transfer. If one component or device fails, it can trigger malfunctions in other components or devices as well, highlighting the multifactorial and interconnected nature of failures. Therefore, when diagnosing the root cause of a malfunction, it’s essential to thoroughly consider all relevant factors involved. Delayed Response During operation, equipment components are continuously subjected to factors such as impact, stress, friction, wear, and corrosion, leading to vibrations, displacements, deformations, fatigue, and crack propagation. These processes gradually degrade the equipment's condition—until, at a certain point, the degradation becomes severe enough to result in mechanical malfunctions or even complete loss of functionality. The time-lag inherent in this failure progression underscores the importance of identifying potential issues early on and implementing preventive measures promptly, thereby minimizing the damage that could arise when a failure ultimately occurs. Uncertainty (Ambiguity) A single fault phenomenon can arise from multiple underlying causes; conversely, a single cause may manifest in various fault symptoms. The occurrence of faults, their specific manifestations, quantitative descriptions, and detection analyses all involve inherent uncertainties, thereby complicating the tasks of fault diagnosis and repair.

1.2 Basics of Equipment Maintenance 1.2.1 Maintenance Method The method of equipment maintenance carries the meaning of a maintenance strategy. Modern equipment management emphasizes applying different maintenance approaches to various types of equipment, underscoring that equipment repair should align with the objective principles governing the physical lifecycle of machinery and materials. This approach ensures production continuity while optimizing the efficient use of maintenance resources, ultimately achieving the most cost-effective outcome over the equipment's entire lifespan. Commonly used maintenance methods for electromechanical equipment include the following: Reactive Maintenance Post-failure maintenance, also known as breakdown maintenance, damage repair, or unplanned maintenance, refers to repairs carried out after mechanical and electrical equipment has malfunctioned—essentially, ""if it breaks, we fix it."" For certain critical equipment, post-failure maintenance should be minimized whenever possible; however, for devices that have minimal impact on production or are backed up by redundant units, opting for post-failure maintenance is often the most cost-effective approach. Preventive Maintenance Maintenance performed before mechanical and electrical equipment fails is called preventive maintenance. Its main benefits include reducing unexpected equipment failures, ensuring continuous production, integrating equipment upkeep and repair tasks into a structured plan—thereby minimizing unplanned disruptions in production—and ultimately improving equipment utilization, lowering maintenance costs, and extending the equipment's natural lifespan. Preventive maintenance is categorized into two basic forms: Regular maintenance Regular maintenance is also known as planned maintenance or time-based preventive maintenance. It involves carrying out preventive maintenance activities at predetermined intervals and follows a cyclical pattern. This type of maintenance is based on the wear patterns of components, with specific guidelines for setting maintenance intervals, defining maintenance categories, outlining maintenance tasks, and estimating the associated workload. However, this approach to maintenance can lead to certain challenges: First, when equipment is still in good technical condition and fully capable of continuing operation, it may undergo major over-maintenance simply because the scheduled interval has arrived—resulting in unnecessary repairs. Second, if a machine’s technical condition has already deteriorated to the point where it can no longer meet production requirements, but the prescribed maintenance interval hasn’t yet been reached, no repair plan will be implemented, leading to under-maintenance. This method is particularly well-suited for process-oriented production equipment or power systems where the wear patterns are well understood, and operations are stable and contin uous—such as large-scale assembly line equipment or key machinery operating on automated production lines. Currently, China primarily implements two main types of equipment mainten ance systems: the Planned Preventive Maintenance System and the Planned Warranty System. (1) Planned Preventive Maintenance System (referred to as Planned Pre-Maintenance). This sy stem involves maintaining, inspecting, and repairing equipment according to its wear patterns, adhering to predetermined maintenance cycles and procedures, to ensure that the equip ment consistently remains in optimal technical condition. Its key features are outlined below. ① Perform daily cleaning, inspection, lubrication, tightening, and adjustments on equ ipment as required to minimize wear and ensure proper operation. ② Conduct regular inspections and adjustments of the equipment's operational status and wear levels according to th e prescribed schedule, ensuring that potential issues are promptly addressed. This allows you to monitor changes in the equipment's technical condition and adequately prepare the n ecessary resources for scheduled maintenance. ③ Conduct preventive maintenance on equipment in a planned and prepared manner. (2) The Planned Maintenance System (also known as the  Maintenance and Repair System) is a equipment maintenance approach that combines routine upkeep with scheduled inspections and repairs. Its key features are outlined below. ① Based  on the equipment's characteristics and condition, different maintenance categories and intervals are specified according to operational hours (such as production output and mileag e).
1.2.7 Patterns of Failure Occurrence Mechanical and electrical equipment failures exhibit two notable characteristics: first, the likelihood of failure increases as the equipment ages; second, failures occur randomly, making it difficult to predict the exact timing of any given failure. Consequently, over the equipment's lifespan, the probability of a failure can be expressed using statistical methods. The failure rate, denoted by ( \lambda(t) ), represents the conditional probability that a failure will occur within the infinitesimal time interval ( dt ), given that no failure has yet happened up to time ( t ).

1.3.4 Fracture of Mechanical Parts Fracture refers to the phenomenon where a mechanical component develops localized cracks or splits into several parts under the influence of certain factors. It is one of the primary modes of mechanical component failure—once a part fractures, it not only completely loses its functionality but can also lead to significant economic losses and even cause accidents resulting in injuries or fatalities. Particularly as modern manufacturing systems continue to evolve toward higher power levels and faster rotational speeds, the operating conditions for components have changed dramatically, increasing the likelihood of fracture-related failures. As a result, fracture failure has become a hot topic of research today. The fracture surface formed after a part breaks can accurately capture the dynamic evolution of the failure process. By analyzing the fracture surface, it is possible to identify the primary cause of the fracture, providing valuable insights that help refine designs and enable effective repairs. Based on the cause of failure, fractures can be categorized into types such as brittle fracture and fatigue fracture. Brittle Fracture Before fracturing, the component exhibits no noticeable plastic deformation; this type of fracture, which develops extremely rapidly, is known as brittle fracture.  Brittle fracture occurs without any prior warning signs, making it a sudden and highly dangerous form of failure. Metal parts may become brittle—and thus prone to sudden fracture— due to improper manufacturing processes, exposure to corrosive media during use, or adverse environmental conditions. For instance, the penetration of hydrogen or hydrides into met al materials can lead to  ""hydrogen embrittlement, "" while chloride ions infiltrating austenitic stainless steel may cause  ""chloride stress corrosion cracking. "" Similarly, nitrate ions entering carbon steel can trigger  ""nitrate embrittlement, "" and steel in contact with alkaline substances might suffer from  ""alkali embrittlement. "" Additionally, copper components exposed to ammonia can experience  ""ammonia-induced embrittlement. "" Furthermore, at ambient temperatures between 10°C and 15°C, medium- to low-strength carbon steels are particularly susceptible to  ""cold embrittlement "" (often caused by elevated phosphorus content in the steel). Meanwhile, aluminum-containing alloys, if not carefully temperature-controlled during heat treatment, can easily overh eat—even with only a slight deviation from the optimal range—leading to severe embrittlement. The hazards posed by brittle fracture in metals are significant, second only to those  associated with fatigue failure. Fatigue Fracture The fracture phenomenon that occurs in metal parts after being subjected to a certain number of cyclic loads or alternating stresses is known as fatigue failure. In fact, 80% of fractures in mechanical components during use are caused by fatigue. Typically, fatigue failure progresses through three distinct stages: the initiation phase of fatigue cracks; the propagation phase of fatigue cracks; and finally, catastrophic failure—the unstable, rapid growth phase of the fatigue crack. Below, we will analyze the fracture surfaces associated with fatigue failure. A typical fatigue fracture typically exhibits 3 distinct features based on the fracture process. Regions with distinct characteristics: fatigue core zone, fatigue crack propagation Zone and transient zone, as shown in Figure 1.4. Fatigue Core Zone It is the source region of fatigue fracture, visible to the naked eye or under low magnification. A magnifying glass can pinpoint the location of the fatigue core on the fracture surface—it typically does. Appearing in the area with the lowest intensity, highest stress, and closest to the surface Position. But if there are defects inside the material, this fatigue core... It could also occur at the defect site. Scratches left behind during the machining, storage, transportation, and assembly processes are highly likely to become fatigue nuclei, as these marks not only cause stress concentrations but also remain vulnerable to corrosion damage from air and other environmental factors. Figure 1.4: Schematic Diagram of Fatigue Fracture Features (Uniaxial Bending)
147 Electrical equipment can experience a wide variety of failures during operation, leading to equipment shutdowns that disrupt production—and in severe cases, even result in personal injuries or equipment accidents. The causes of these failures include, in addition to the natural aging of electrical components, a significant number of issues arising from neglecting routine maintenance and upkeep of the equipment. This often allows minor problems to escalate into major incidents. Additionally, some failures occur due to improper handling techniques employed by electrical technicians when addressing faults, reliance on makeshift solutions due to missing parts, or misjudgments and inaccurate measurements that inadvertently widen the scope of the problem. Therefore, to ensure the reliable operation of electrical equipment, minimize downtime caused by repairs, and ultimately enhance equipment utilization and overall productivity, it is crucial to prioritize regular maintenance and proper care of electrical systems. Furthermore, it’s essential to maintain an adequate stock of key electrical components and frequently replaced parts tailored to the specific needs of each facility’s equipment and production processes. 5.1 Causes and Types of Electrical Faults Electrical equipment failures are inevitable. Even with effective measures such as daily maintenance, routine inspections, and periodic calibration and repairs, it remains impossible to guarantee the long-term, flawless operation of electrical devices without ever encountering an electrical fault. Causes of Electrical Faults Electrical faults primarily arise from the following two factors. (1) Natural Failures. During operation, electrical equipment is often subjected to numerous adverse factors. For example, mechanical vibrations during equipment operation; the thermal effects of overcurrents accelerating insulation degradation and deterioration of electrical components; arcing that causes damage; natural wear and tear from prolonged use; environmental influences such as temperature and humidity; corrosion from harmful substances; inherent quality issues within the components themselves; and even the equipment's natural lifespan—all these can lead to various types of failures that disrupt normal functioning. Therefore, strengthening routine maintenance, upkeep, and periodic inspections can help ensure that electrical equipment remains trouble-free—or experiences far fewer failures—for an extended period. However, it’s crucial not to mistakenly assume that equipment failures are inevitable and thus overlook the importance of consistent daily maintenance and regular overhaul work. (2) Human-induced failures. During operation, electrical equipment can experience accidents—or even pose risks to personal safety—due to unintended mechanical forces causing damage, improper handling, or inadequate installation practices. Types of Electrical Faults Due to the diverse structures of electrical equipment and the wide variety of electrical components, the factors that lead to electrical failures are equally numerous. Consequently, the faults that occur in electrical devices are bound to be just as varied and complex. Classified by Failure Phenomenon Fault phenomena can be broadly categorized into the following two main types. (1) Faults with obvious external characteristics that are easy to detect. For example, significant heating, smoking, emitting a burnt odor, or sparking in motors or electrical equipment. These types of failures typically result from motor or equipment winding overloads, insulation breakdown, short circuits, or ground faults. When addressing these issues, in addition to replacing or repairing the faulty components, it’s essential to identify and eliminate the root causes that led to the problems in the first place. (2) Failures with No Visible Symptoms. This type of failure is a major issue in control circuits, often caused by improper adjustment of electrical components, mechanical malfunctions, poor or loose contact at contacts and crimped wire terminals, as well as the damage of small parts or even broken wires. The more complex the circuit, the higher the likelihood of encountering these kinds of faults. Although minor, they occur frequently—and because they lack obvious external signs, pinpointing the exact fault location can often take considerable time. In some cases, it may even require consulting specialized tutorials on diagnosing and repairing electromechanical system failures. 148"

They are often preceded by no obvious warning signs, making them difficult to predict even through early-stage testing or trials. Such failures usually result from a combination of inherent adverse factors within the process system and unpredictable external influences. (2) Gradual failure. These failures develop slowly and typically occur during the later stages of an electromechanical device's useful life. Their likelihood of occurrence is closely tied to the equipment's usage time, and they can often be predicted through early-stage testing or monitoring. Such failures usually result from the gradual progression of issues like corrosion, wear, fatigue, and material aging in the components. 4) By the cause of fault formation (1) Failures caused by operational or management errors, such as using机电 equipment under conditions that deviate from the original design specifications, leading to improper equipment usage. (2) Failures caused by inherent system factors. These typically arise from defects left over from system design or manufacturing—such as residual stresses or localized weak points—or from latent flaws within the materials themselves. Such failures are unpredictable and represent a major cause of sudden, unexpected breakdowns. (3) Natural failures. During the operational and maintenance period, mechanical and electrical equipment may experience failures caused by various external or internal natural factors—such as wear, fracture, corrosion, deformation, creep, aging, and other forms of damage that occur under normal conditions. 5) By the consequences caused by the failure (1) Critical Failure: A failure that endangers personal safety, results in injury or death, causes the scrapping of机电 equipment, or leads to significant financial losses. Examples include frame or body separation, wheel detachment, and complete engine assembly failure. (2) Minor faults. These are issues that affect the normal operation of mechanical and electrical equipment but can be resolved within a relatively short time. Examples include broken drive belts, damaged control handles, cracks or loose welds in sheet metal components, faulty electrical switches, minor leaks, and loose general fasteners. 6) By the period when the fault occurred (1) Early-stage failures. These faults may arise from design, manufacturing, or material defects and typically become apparent shortly after the equipment is first put into operation. Alternatively, certain components—such as gear pairs in gearboxes or other friction-based assemblies—often require an initial ""running-in"" period before their performance gradually improves. Once these early-stage issues are identified, addressed, and optimized, the failure rate tends to decline over time. (2) Failure during the useful life. This refers to failures that occur within a product's effective lifespan, caused by unpredictable, random factors related to both external loads (such as operational conditions) and intrinsic system characteristics (including internal factors like component failures or structural damage). Since equipment typically operates in this condition for most of its lifetime, the failure rate during this period remains relatively constant. Therefore, monitoring and diagnosing failures during this phase is critically important. (3) Late-stage failures (dissipation-phase failures). These typically occur during the latter part of a device's lifespan, often after the equipment has been in use for an extended period—or even beyond its intended service life. Such failures arise due to gradual wear, fatigue, and aging of the equipment's components, leading to a decline in system functionality. Ultimately, this can result in sudden, hazardous, and potentially widespread system breakdowns. During this phase, the failure rate of the equipment tends to increase steadily. To prevent accidents, it’s crucial to monitor and diagnose the system regularly, promptly replacing any identified failing components before they cause a major incident. As illustrated by the classification of these failures, mechanical and electrical equipment malfunctions are often interconnected and can evolve over time—shifting from one type of failure to another. Ultimately, every type of machinery and equipment failure will manifest as a specific issue, underscoring the importance of comprehensive diagnostic and maintenance strategies. 5
Due to various reasons, the early failure period may reappear after major equipment repairs or upgrades. 2. Random Failure Period During the random failure period, the failure rate remains low and stable, nearly constant. Random failures are caused by偶然 factors—they are unpredictable and cannot be eliminated even by extending the running-in phase. Design flaws, component defects, inadequate maintenance, and improper operation can all lead to random failures. 3. Wear-Out Failure Phase The characteristic of wear-out failures is that the failure rate increases as operating time accumulates. Wear-out failures are caused by factors such as wear fatigue, aging, and corrosion of equipment components. These types of failures typically indicate that the equipment is approaching its major overhaul period or nearing the end of its service life."

When critical components of machinery fail, it indicates that the equipment has entered a state of malfunction. Machine failures are inherently linked to the failure of mechanical parts. Given the wide variety of mechanical equipment types, along with significant differences in operating conditions and environmental factors, the failure modes of mechanical components also vary widely. Among these, the four most common and representative failure modes are wear, corrosion, deformation, and fracture. 1.3.1 Wear of Mechanical Components Wear of mechanical components is the primary failure mode for parts. In typical mechanical equipment, approximately 80% of failed or scrapped components are due to wear-related issues. Wear not only reduces the efficiency and reliability of机电设备 but can also lead to premature failure of the equipment itself. Therefore, conducting research into the wear mechanisms of机电设备 can help us understand the specific wear characteristics of various components, providing a solid foundation for developing effective maintenance strategies and schedules—and ultimately extending the service life of the equipment. 1. General Patterns of Part Wear Wear is a microscopic and dynamic process that occurs as parts wear down. Various physical, chemical, and mechanical phenomena occur, along with their external manifestations. The state refers to the wear of the surface material, and the extent of wear is typically measured by abrasion. Measure, measure. Under normal operating conditions, the wear process of the part is divided into 3 stages. Phase, as shown in Figure 1.3, where w represents the wear amount. 1) Fitting-in Phase OA It occurs during the initial phase of equipment use. At this stage, the surfaces of the friction pair exhibit micro-… Observing the wave peaks results in a smaller actual contact area between the parts, leading to increased contact stress. Very large, resulting in plastic deformation and wear at the surface of the running parts at a rapid rate.
1.2.7 Patterns of Failure Occurrence Mechanical and electrical equipment failures exhibit two notable characteristics: first, the likelihood of failure increases as the equipment ages; second, failures occur randomly, making it difficult to predict the exact timing of any given failure. Consequently, over the equipment's lifespan, the probability of a failure can be expressed using statistical methods. The failure rate, denoted by ( \lambda(t) ), represents the conditional probability that a failure will occur within the infinitesimal time interval ( dt ), given that no failure has yet happened up to time ( t ).

This equation shows that the failure rate is specific to a particular instant. Potential failure rate relative to the instantaneous probability of no failure The ratio. Most failures occur at times and frequencies that correlate with the machine's The usage time of electrical equipment is closely linked. Engineering practice Experience and experimentation show that the failure rate of机电 equipment varies. Divided into the early failure phase, the random failure phase, and the wear-out failure phase. It consists of 3 stages, as shown in Figure 1.2. 1. Early Failure Phase The early failure period is characterized by a higher failure rate, but The failure rate decreases rapidly as the equipment's operating time increases. Early failures are typically caused by design or manufacturing defects.

(1) The defined object. This refers to a single machine, a system composed of several individual machines, or a specific component on the equipment. Different objects may experience varying failure conditions at the same time. For instance, on an automated production line, the failure of a single machine can be enough to disable the entire system; however, in a workshop with a clustered machine layout, the failure of one machine would not necessarily be linked to a breakdown affecting the entire workshop. (2) Time-to-failure. This refers to the fact that the probability of a failure increases as time goes on. In addition to using direct units like years, months, days, or hours, time can also be measured by the number of equipment operations, mileage, or cycles. For instance, vehicles typically use total miles driven as their unit of measurement, while gears might be measured by the number of load-bearing cycles they endure. (3) The specified conditions. These refer to the operational and maintenance conditions during equipment operation, the skill level of personnel, environmental factors, and more. Different conditions will lead to different types of failures. (4) The specified function. It depends on the particular issue at hand. For example, in a lathe operating in the same state, damage to the feed screw would be considered a malfunction when it comes to threading operations—but not when machining end faces, since the two scenarios require different functional capabilities from the lathe. (5) A certain degree of failure. This refers to assessing the severity of functional loss from a quantitative perspective. In production practice, to encompass all possible events, a broad definition of failure has been established: ""A failure is an unqualified state."" 1.1.2 Classification of Failures Mechanical and electrical equipment failures can be categorized from various perspectives, with each classification method highlighting a different aspect of the fault. The purpose of categorizing failures is to assess the severity of the incident, analyze its root causes, and ultimately enable more effective, tailored responses to address the specific types of malfunctions. By examining factors such as failure nature, underlying causes, and distinctive characteristics, faults can be grouped into the following categories. By fault nature (1) Intermittent failures. The equipment temporarily loses certain functions, with the faults often caused by external factors affecting the mechanical and electrical systems—such as operator error, climate changes, or inadequate environmental conditions. Once the external interference is removed or the equipment undergoes minor repairs and adjustments, its functionality typically resumes. (2) Permanent failure. Once this type of failure occurs, it can only be restored through manual repair; otherwise, the fault will persist indefinitely. Such failures are typically caused by damage to specific components. 2) By Severity of the Fault (1) Localized failure. A specific part of the机电 equipment is malfunctioning, causing that particular component to lose its functionality while other parts continue to operate as intended—essentially, a partial functional breakdown. (2) Systemic Failure. A failure that results in the complete loss of system functionality—though it may initially appear as a malfunction in a specific component, it ultimately prevents the device from performing its intended function altogether.

Condition-Based Maintenance System It is based on reliability theory, condition monitoring, and fault diagnosis, determining the timing and scope of maintenance based on actual technical condition assessments of mechanical and electrical equipment. Given that many complex mechanical and electrical systems typically experience only early or occasional failures—without a wear-out phase—regular, scheduled maintenance often proves ineffective against such faults. Moreover, in modern mechanical and electrical systems, only a small number of component failures pose safety risks; thus, maintenance tasks should be tailored specifically to the functional requirements of each part, considering potential functional failures, their root causes, and their consequences. This maintenance approach is characterized by flexible decision-making regarding maintenance cycles, procedures, and scopes—adapting dynamically to the actual conditions of the equipment. It shifts the focus of maintenance activities from routine repairs and upkeep to proactive inspections, underpinned by the implementation of a systematic inspection system. Not only does this inspection process provide critical information for determining optimal maintenance timing and scope, but it also allows certain maintenance tasks to be carried out incrementally and efficiently. By conducting daily, periodic, and precision inspections of mechanical and electrical equipment, combined with thorough analysis of condition-monitoring and fault-diagnosis data, operators can accurately assess the degree of degradation and proactively address issues before they escalate into full-blown failures. This approach ensures that equipment remains reliably operational while maximizing the lifespan of its components—making it far more efficient and cost-effective than traditional planned preventive maintenance strategies. To successfully implement condition-based maintenance, several prerequisites must be met: robust reliability testing data and comprehensive documentation are essential for effectively managing the mechanical and electrical systems.

Due to various reasons, the early failure period may reappear after major equipment repairs or upgrades. 2. Random Failure Period During the random failure period, the failure rate remains low and stable, nearly constant. Random failures are caused by偶然因素—they are unpredictable and cannot be eliminated even by extending the running-in phase. Design flaws, component defects, inadequate maintenance, and improper operation can all lead to random failures. 3. Wear-Out Failure Phase The characteristic of wear-out failures is that the failure rate increases as operating time accumulates. Wear-out failures are caused by factors such as wear fatigue, aging, and corrosion of equipment components. These types of failures typically indicate that the equipment is approaching its major overhaul period or nearing the end of its service life. 1.3 Failure Modes of Mechanical Components and Corresponding Countermeasures During equipment operation, the phenomenon where mechanical components lose their intended functionality due to various factors such as design, materials, manufacturing processes, and assembly—rendering them unable to continue working—is referred to as failure. When critical components of machinery fail, it indicates that the equipment has entered a state of malfunction. Machine failures are inherently linked to the failure of mechanical parts. Given the wide variety of mechanical equipment types, along with significant differences in operating conditions and environmental factors, the failure modes of mechanical components also vary widely. Among these, the four most common and representative failure modes are wear, corrosion, deformation, and fracture. 1.3.1 Wear of Mechanical Components Wear of mechanical components is the primary failure mode for parts. In typical mechanical equipment, approximately 80% of failed or scrapped components are due to wear-related issues. Wear not only reduces the efficiency and reliability of机电设备 but can also lead to premature failure of the equipment itself. Therefore, conducting research into the wear mechanisms of机电设备 can help us understand the specific wear characteristics of various components, providing a solid foundation for developing effective maintenance strategies and schedules—and ultimately extending the service life of the equipment. 1.

Various physical, chemical, and mechanical phenomena occur, along with their external manifestations. The state refers to the wear of the surface material, and the extent of wear is typically measured by abrasion. Measure, measure.

At this stage, the surfaces of the friction pair exhibit micro-… Observing the wave peaks results in a smaller actual contact area between the parts, leading to increased contact stress. Very large, resulting in plastic deformation and wear at the surface of the running parts at a rapid rate.
3. Cavitation When a part comes into contact wi th a liquid and experiences relative motion, bubbles form at the contact point if the local pressure drops below the liquid's vapor pressure. As these bubbles move toward high-pres sure areas, they are compressed and deformed by the intense external pressure—eventually leading to their collapse. A Tutorial on Fault Diagnosis and Repair of Electro-Mechanical Systems Involving Bubble Formation 22 When bubbles are forced to collapse, their rapid implosion—at speeds as high a s 250 m/s—immediately generates an enormous impact force and extremely high temperatures. Under the combined effects of this intense force and extreme heat, localized liquids can e ject tiny jets of liquid outward. This phenomenon is known as cavitation. If a bubble collapses right at the surface of a component, the surface itself comes under direct impact from these microjets. Over time, as bubbles repeatedly form and burst in close proximity to the surface, the material on the component’s surface is continuously bombarded by these high-speed liquid jets. This relentless erosion eventually leads to fatigue, causing the material to gradually flake off—initially forming small pitting marks that, over time, expand into a sponge-like, foam-like texture. This process is commonly referred to as cavitation damage. Cavitation is a relatively complex destructive phenomenon that involves not only mechanical effects but also chemical and electrochemical processes. This destructive process is exacerbated when the liquid contains impurities or abrasive particles. Cavitation commonly occurs on the outer walls of diesel engine cylinder liners, pump components, turbine blades, and hydraulic pumps, among other areas. Measures to reduce cavitation primarily include: (1) To reduce the occurrence of water hammer by minimizing vibrations on surfaces in contact with liquids, methods such as increasing rigidity, improving support systems, and implementing vibration-damping measures can be employed. (2) Select materials resistant to cavitation, such as cast iron with spherical or nodular graphite, stainless steel, nylon, and others. (3) Parts can be coated with anti-cavitation materials such as plastic or ceramic, or they can also be surface-chromed. (4) Improve the part structure, reduce surface roughness values, and minimize vortex formation during liquid flow. (5) Add emulsified oil to the water to reduce the impact force during bubble bursts. 1.3.3 Deformation of Mechanical Parts In practice, it often happens that although worn parts have been repaired and restored to their original dimensions, shape, and fit, the equipment still fails to achieve its original technical performance after assembly. This is usually due to deformation of the parts, particularly It is caused by the deformation of basic components, which disrupts the positional accuracy between parts and, in turn, affects the relationships among the individual components. Deformation in mechanical parts or components can be categorized into two types: elastic deformation and plastic deformation. Elastic Deformation Elastic deformation is the type of deformation that fully recovers once the external force is removed. After a material undergoes elastic deformation, it may exhibit an elastic aftereffect: when the external force is suddenly released, the strain doesn’t vanish entirely right away—it disappears only partially, with the remaining portion gradually dissipating over time. This phenomenon, where the strain lags behind the applied stress, is known as the elastic aftereffect. The extent of the elastic aftereffect depends on factors such as the material’s properties, the magnitude of the stress, its initial state, and the temperature. Specifically, the more non-uniform the metal’s microstructure, the greater the applied stress, and the higher the temperature, the more pronounced the elastic aftereffect will be. Typically, after straightening, shaft-like components tend to bend again after some time—this is a clear manifestation of the elastic aftereffect. To eliminate this phenomenon, one effective method is to perform prolonged tempering, which ensures that residual stresses are completely relieved within a short period. Plastic Deformation Plastic deformation refers to the type of deformation that does not fully recover once the external force is removed. Its key characteristics include: ① it leads to changes in the material's microstructure and properties, resulting in work hardening of the metal; ② since polycrystalline materials undergo uneven deformation across individual grains and even within the same grain during plastic deformation, the elastic recovery of each grain differs after the external force is removed, leading to residual stresses; ③ plastic deformation enhances atomic mobility, thereby reducing the metal's corrosion resistance. Plastic deformation of metal parts, viewed from macroscopic morphological features, includes volume deformation, warping deformation, and aging deformation. Volume deformation refers to the phenomenon where metal parts expand or contract in volume due to changes in thermal capacity caused by phase transformations during heating and cooling processes. Warping deformation, on the other hand, involves plastic deformation that results in bending or twisting of the part, with the primary cause being failures outlined in Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance. 23 It involves deformations of various types (such as bending, torsion, tension-compression, etc.) and in different directions. These deformations are commonly observed in slender shaft-like, thin plate-shaped components, as well as in thin-walled annular and sleeve-type parts. Age-related deformation is caused by changes in stress. 3. Measures to Prevent and Reduce Deformation of Mechanical Parts Deformation is inevitable, but appropriate measures can be taken from the following four areas to prevent and minimize mechanical part deformation. 1) Design aspect
1.4.1 Preparations Before Mechanical Equipment Maintenance Electromechanical equipment occupies a critically important position in the production and operational activities of modern industrial enterprises. To ensure smooth equipment operation and safe production, implementing planned preventive maintenance is an essential component of equipment management and repair practices in industrial companies. This section will cover the detailed process of major equipment overhauls, the determination of equipment repair plans, as well as the technical and material preparations required prior to equipment maintenance. 1. Equipment Major Overhaul Process To ensure the precision and operational performance of mechanical and electrical equipment, preventive scheduled maintenance must be carried out in addition to routine upkeep. Among these preventive measures, major overhauls stand out as a critical task aimed at restoring the equipment's accuracy. Within the category of preventive maintenance, major overhauls—often referred to simply as ""overhauls""—represent the most extensive and time-consuming type of repair. An overhaul involves completely or largely disassembling the equipment, repairing or replacing foundational components, refurbishing mechanical and electrical parts, recalibrating the electrical systems, and finally reassembling and fine-tuning the entire unit. The ultimate goal is to thoroughly eliminate any pre-existing defects and restore the equipment to its specified performance standards. The purpose of precision and performance. The major steps involved in the overhaul of mechanical and electrical equipment typically include: pre-disassembly unit inspection, component removal, component inspection, necessary component disassembly, parts cleaning and examination, component repair and assembly, final assembly, no-load trial operation, load testing, overall machine precision verification, and final acceptance. In practice, these tasks should be carried out according to the overhaul work plan, while also ensuring effective job scheduling, quality control during operations, and thorough completion acceptance. The major overhaul process for mechanical and electrical equipment is typically divided into three stages: pre-repair preparation, the repair process itself, and post-repair acceptance. Pre-repair preparation phase To ensure the repair work proceeds smoothly and accurately, maintenance personnel should carefully listen to operators' requirements for equipment repairs and thoroughly understand the issues affecting the equipment being serviced—such as loss of precision, the extent of wear on major mechanical components, the accuracy of the transmission system, and any visible defects. They should also identify which parts need improvement or modification to meet the equipment’s operational specifications. Additionally, they should review relevant technical documentation, equipment manuals, and previous maintenance records to become familiar with the device’s structural features, transmission system, and original design precision standards. This preparation will enable them to propose comprehensive pre-inspection tasks. Following the pre-inspection, specific repair methods for critical and large components can be determined, allowing for the preparation of specialized tools and precision measuring instruments. Finally, the team must define the post-repair precision testing procedures and establish clear acceptance criteria for trial runs, ensuring all technical preparations are fully in place before proceeding with the complete overhaul of the equipment.

The material condition and characteristics. 1.1.3 Characteristics of the Failure Diversity Various pieces of equipment not only differ in structure and process parameters, but also vary in their manufacturing, installation processes, and operating environments—leading to a wide range of potential failures during operation. Hierarchical Structure Once a device exhibits a certain failure symptom, it becomes necessary to investigate the root cause of the malfunction. However, some failure causes are often deeply rooted—meaning that a higher-level failure stems from a lower-level one, creating a hierarchical pattern. Multifactorial and Correlation The components of the equipment—and even individual devices—are interconnected through mechanical structures or material transfer. If one component or device fails, it can trigger malfunctions in other components or devices as well, highlighting the multifactorial and interconnected nature of failures. Therefore, when diagnosing the root cause of a malfunction, it’s essential to thoroughly consider all relevant factors involved. Delayed Response During operation, equipment components are continuously subjected to factors such as impact, stress, friction, wear, and corrosion, leading to vibrations, displacements, deformations, fatigue, and crack propagation. These processes gradually degrade the equipment's condition—until, at a certain point, the degradation becomes severe enough to result in mechanical malfunctions or even complete loss of functionality. The time-lag inherent in this failure progression underscores the importance of identifying potential issues early on and implementing preventive measures promptly, thereby minimizing the damage that could arise when a failure ultimately occurs. Uncertainty (Ambiguity) A single fault phenomenon can arise from multiple underlying causes; conversely, a single cause may manifest in various fault symptoms. The occurrence of faults, their specific manifestations, quantitative descriptions, and detection analyses all involve inherent uncertainties, thereby complicating the tasks of fault diagnosis and repair.

Typically, equipment can undergo daily inspections, routine patrols, and periodic checks (including precision assessments), as well as integrity assessments—using human senses and common diagnostic tools—to closely monitor the technical status and any unusual signs in components, mechanisms, and areas prone to failure. At the same time, inspection standards should be established to clearly define the boundaries between normal operation, abnormalities, and equipment failures. (4) To quickly locate the fault location and its cause, in addition to providing training to ensure that maintenance and operational staff acquire a solid understanding of electrical and hydraulic technologies, it is also essential to compile common equipment failure symptoms, analysis procedures, and troubleshooting methods into a fault-finding logic flowchart. This will enable operators to swiftly identify the source and root cause of any malfunction after it occurs, allowing for timely diagnosis, repair, and restoration of equipment functionality. (5) Improve the fault recording system. Fault records serve as the foundational data for effective fault management and also provide the original basis for conducting fault analysis and troubleshooting. Records must be complete and accurate. After on-site inspections and fault repairs, maintenance personnel should follow the ""Equipment Carefully complete the  ""Equipment Failure Repair Form "" and submit monthly statistical analyses to the equipment management department. (6) Conduct timely statistics and analysis of equipment failures. In addition to monitoring failur e situations on a daily basis, staff members should compile  ""Failure Repair Forms "" and maintenance records on a monthly basis. By systematically collecting, organizing, and analyzing failure data, it’s possible to calculate the failure frequency and mean time b etween failures for each type of equipment. Furthermore, this process allows for an in-depth analysis of individual equipment failure trends and identifies key root causes, helping  to pinpoint recurring patterns. Armed with this insight, teams can prioritize their response strategies effectively. Finally, the compiled and analyzed failure information should  be shared back with the planning department, enabling them to schedule preventive maintenance or implement improvement measures. This data can also serve as a valuable reference fo r adjusting the intervals, content, and standards of routine inspections. (7) Implement different countermeasures based on the nature of the failure, the type of fault, and the spe cific characteristics of the equipment. For newly acquired equipment, strengthen management during the initial phase of use—carefully monitor and document the equipment’s precision , performance, and any emerging defects from the outset. During operation, emphasize routine maintenance, regular patrol inspections, and periodic checks to promptly identify early  warning signs and take appropriate adjustment or troubleshooting actions. For critical equipment, conduct condition monitoring and diagnostics. Establish a flexible and responsive  maintenance team equipped with advanced technical expertise, employing rapid repair techniques such as component-by-component fixes or group-based replacements. Ensure timely avai lability of high-quality spare parts, leverage production downtime for equipment overhauls, and apply measures like retrofitting or replacing components when wear patterns have bee n thoroughly understood. (8) Carry out routine maintenance tasks effectively to control equipment failures. Utilize status information and early warning signs of potential issues g athered during daily rounds by regional maintenance workers, as well as scheduled equipment condition checks, along with relevant records and analysis data. Based on the specific c haracteristics of each type of equipment and the general defects already identified, the workshop’s equipment mechanic (technician) or maintenance team leader should promptly sched ule routine repairs—ideally during production downtime or weekend slots—to proactively address problems before they escalate, thereby minimizing breakdowns. For certain failure ind icators or hidden risks that exceed the scope of routine maintenance, these should be reported back to the planning department for scheduling dedicated, planned maintenance activit ies instead. (9) Establish a rational fault information management flowchart.
16 1. Equipment Fault Diagnosis Process Equipment fault diagnosis encompasses three key areas: condition monitoring, analytical diagnosis, and fault prediction. The specific implementation process can be summarized into the following four steps. 1) Signal Acquisition During operation, equipment inevitably experiences changes in various quantities such as force, heat, vibration, and energy, generating a wide range of distinct information. Depending on specific diagnostic needs, it is crucial to select signals that accurately reflect the equipment's operational status—such as vibration, pressure, or temperature—since these signals are typically captured using different types of sensors. 2) Signal Processing This is the process of classifying and processing the collected signals to extract features that accurately represent the machine's characteristics—also known as feature extraction. For example, transforming a vibration signal from the time domain to the frequency domain for spectral analysis is part of this process. 3) State Recognition The device's characteristic parameters, obtained after signal processing, are compared with the specified allowable or discriminant parameters to determine the device's condition. The current status—whether a fault exists, and if so, its type and nature. To address this, appropriate identification criteria and diagnostic strategies should be carefully developed. 4) Diagnostic Decision-making
Due to various reasons, the early failure period may reappear after major equipment repairs or upgrades. 2. Random Failure Period During the random failure period, the failure rate remains low and stable, nearly constant. Random failures are caused by偶然因素—they are unpredictable and cannot be eliminated even by extending the running-in phase. Design flaws, component defects, inadequate maintenance, and improper operation can all lead to random failures. 3. Wear-Out Failure Phase The characteristic of wear-out failures is that the failure rate increases as operating time accumulates. Wear-out failures are caused by factors such as wear fatigue, aging, and corrosion of equipment components. These types of failures typically indicate that the equipment is approaching its major overhaul period or nearing the end of its service life. 1.3 Failure Modes of Mechanical Components and Corresponding Countermeasures During equipment operation, the phenomenon where mechanical components lose their intended functionality due to various factors such as design, materials, manufacturing processes, and assembly—rendering them unable to continue working—is referred to as failure. When critical components of machinery fail, it indicates that the equipment has entered a state of malfunction. Machine failures are inherently linked to the failure of mechanical parts. Given the wide variety of mechanical equipment types, along with significant differences in operating conditions and environmental factors, the failure modes of mechanical components also vary widely. Among these, the four most common and representative failure modes are wear, corrosion, deformation, and fracture. 1.3.1 Wear of Mechanical Components Wear of mechanical components is the primary failure mode for parts. In typical mechanical equipment, approximately 80% of failed or scrapped components are due to wear-related issues. Wear not only reduces the efficiency and reliability of机电设备 but can also lead to premature failure of the equipment itself. Therefore, conducting research into the wear mechanisms of机电设备 can help us understand the specific wear characteristics of various components, providing a solid foundation for developing effective maintenance strategies and schedules—and ultimately extending the service life of the equipment. 1. General Patterns of Part Wear Wear is a microscopic and dynamic process that occurs as parts wear down. Various physical, chemical, and mechanical phenomena occur, along with their external manifestations. The state refers to the wear of the surface material, and the extent of wear is typically measured by abrasion. Measure, measure. Under normal operating conditions, the wear process of the part is divided into 3 stages. Phase, as shown in Figure 1.3, where w represents the wear amount. 1) Fitting-in Phase OA It occurs during the initial phase of equipment use. At this stage, the surfaces of the friction pair exhibit micro-… Observing the wave peaks results in a smaller actual contact area between the parts, leading to increased contact stress. Very large, resulting in plastic deformation and wear at the surface of the running parts at a rapid rate."
How is abrasive wear defined and why is it significant?,"['Abrasive wear occurs when a hard protruding part on one surface of a friction pair comes into contact with the other surface, or when abrasive particles are present between the two rubbing surfaces.', 'Among the many wear failure modes, abrasive wear is not only the most common but also the most severe type of failure.']","Abrasive wear is defined as wear that happens when a hard protruding part on one surface of a friction pair contacts the other surface, or when abrasive particles (such as dust or metal particles) are trapped between the rubbing surfaces. During relative motion, these hard particulates cause material transfer from one surface to another or simultaneous material loss on both surfaces. It is significant because abrasive wear is the most common and severe type of wear failure, leading to substantial degradation in equipment performance and longevity.",text-EN.txt,29,,,"Abrasive wear is defined as occurring when a hard protruding part on one surface of a friction pair contacts the other surface or when abrasive particles are present between the rubbing surfaces, causing material transfer or loss due to hard particulates; it is significant because it is the most common and severe wear failure mode, affecting components like sliding bearings and gear tooth surfaces.","Triplets:

Context:  
The degree is very high. Choose a reasonable running-in load, relative motion speed, and lubrication. Slip conditions and other parameters are key to shortening the break-in period. 2) Stable Wear Phase AB The wear characteristic of this stage is a low and stable wear rate, which is why the duration of this phase is relatively long. But by mid- Figure 1.3: Wear Characteristic Curve –  Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance 19 Later on, the wear rate becomes relatively faster, but the equipment can still function for a while. When the wear amount reaches point B, the wear rate sharply accelerates, marking the onset of the severe wear phase. Proper usage, along with regular maintenance and upkeep of the equipment, is key to extending this critical stage. 3) Rapid Wear Phase BC Once this stage is reached, significant changes in friction conditions occur, such as altered lubrication or shifts in the geometric dimensions of components. Changes, such as increased clearance between mating parts and the generation of impact loads, can cause wear rates to rise sharply. At this point, mechanical efficiency noticeably declines, and precision deteriorates—conditions that, if left unaddressed, could lead to equipment failure or even unexpected accidents. Therefore, promptly identifying and repairing components that are about to enter this stage is critically important. According to wear results, wear is categorized into pitting wear, adhesive wear, abrasive wear, and more; while based on wear mechanisms, it is classified into abrasive wear, fatigue wear, adhesive wear, fretting wear, and others. Abrasive wear occurs when a hard protruding part on one surface of a friction pair comes into contact with the other surface, or when abrasive particles are present between the two rubbing surfaces. Wear occurs when hard particulates—such as dust in the air or metal particles generated by abrasion—cause material transfer from one surface to another, or even simultaneous material loss on both surfaces, during relative motion. Among the many wear failure modes, abrasive wear is not only the most common but also the most severe type of failure. Fretting wear refers to a type of wear where localized areas on the surfaces of friction pairs develop fatigue cracks under cyclic contact stresses, leading to the detachment of micro-sheets or particles. Depending on the nature of contact and relative motion between the friction pairs, fretting wear can be categorized into two main forms: rolling-contact fatigue wear and sliding-contact fatigue wear. In practical applications, pure rolling-contact fatigue wear is relatively rare; most often, it occurs as a combination of rolling and sliding motions. Adhesive wear occurs when, at the points of contact between mating surfaces, ""cold welding"" takes place, causing material from one surface to transfer to the other during relative sliding. Micro-motion wear is a type of wear that occurs when two contacting objects undergo relative vibrations with very small amplitudes. It happens on two closely matched surfaces that appear nominally stationary but actually experience cyclic, minute-scale relative sliding—typically at the micrometer level (2–20 μm). For instance, this phenomenon can be observed at interference or transition-fit interfaces between shafts and holes, on keyway surfaces, or in threaded fasteners. Wear occurring on working surfaces, such as the working surface of the rivet, and other similar areas. Fretting wear not only reduces mating accuracy, loosens tight-fitting components, and degrades the quality of the mating surfaces, but can also lead to the formation of fatigue cracks, significantly diminishing the fatigue strength of the part. 2. Measures to Prevent or Reduce Wear
Below, we'll use a solid sliding bearing as an example to introduce its assembly method. (1) Press-fitting the bushing. Depending on the bushing size and the amount of interference fit, assembly is carried out either by hammering or press-fitting. For smaller dimensions and lighter interference fits, the bushing can be tapped into place using a hand hammer and a backing plate. When the bushing size and interference are larger, a hydraulic press should be used for assembly. If the interference exceeds 0.1 mm, the assembly process involves heating the housing or cooling the bushing to facilitate proper fitting. (2) Fixed bushing. After the bushing is press-fitted, it can be secured against rotation using screws, locating pins, or similar fasteners. (3) Inspection and Adjustment After Assembly. After the bushing is assembled, methods such as reaming, scraping, or honing can be used to ensure that the clearance and contact points between the bushing and the journal meet the specified requirements. 2.3.1 Failure Modes of Sliding Bearings (1) Abrasive wear. Hard particles grinding against the shaft and bearing surfaces cause abrasive wear. (2) Scratches. Hard contour peak tips on the shaft surface scrape against the bearing, resulting in scratches. (3) Galling (adhesion). Galling occurs when temperatures rise, pressure increases, or the oil film breaks down. (4) Fatigue spalling. Repeated loading causes fatigue cracks to propagate, leading to spalling. (5) Corrosion. Oxidation of the lubricant produces acidic substances that cause corrosive damage.
1. Load Distribution Pure axial load: Rolling elements are evenly loaded. Radial load: Uneven loading of rolling elements (loaded and unloaded zones). 2. Failure Modes of Rolling Bearings Pitting: Numerous pitting marks appear on the raceways of both the inner and outer rings, as well as on the surfaces of the rolling elements—primarily caused by improper loading, incorrect assembly (e.g., excessive interference fit or misalignment of the inner and outer rings), and inadequate lubrication. Plastic Deformation: Uneven plastic deformation pits appear on the rolling elements or raceway surfaces, primarily due to excessive static or impact loads. Other forms include abrasive wear, adhesive wear, fracture, rusting, electrochemical corrosion, and abnormal temperature rise, among others.
3) Gear Surface Galling Galling refers to the wear phenomenon caused by the direct contact and adhesion of metal surfaces with interlocking teeth under specific pressure, followed by the tearing off of metal from the tooth surfaces as they move relative to each other. Gluing types include hot gluing and cold gluing. Hot gluing is used for gear transmissions under heavy loads and high speeds, while cold gluing is suitable for gear transmissions involving heavy loads at low speeds. Gluing typically occurs at the top of the gears. To enhance resistance to galling, you can increase the hardness of the tooth surfaces and reduce their roughness. Alternatively, you can also use lubricants with higher viscosity (for low-speed transmissions) or those specifically designed to resist galling (for high-speed transmissions). 4) Tooth Surface Wear Tooth surface wear occurs in two forms: abrasive wear and running-in wear. Abrasive wear happens in open gear drives, while running-in wear typically refers to the running-in process under light loads. Switching to closed-gear transmission is the most effective method to prevent abrasive wear on gear surfaces. Additionally, abrasive wear can be minimized by increasing the surface hardness of the gears, reducing surface roughness, and ensuring proper lubrication. 5) Plastic Deformation of Tooth Surfaces The cause of plastic deformation on gear surfaces is the plastic flow of the softer gear material under heavy loads or frictional forces, resulting in grooves being rolled into the driving gear and protruding ridges being extruded onto the driven gear. This failure typically occurs in transmissions operating at low speeds, under heavy loads, and with frequent start-ups. Measures such as increasing the hardness of gear tooth surfaces and using high-viscosity lubricants can help prevent or reduce plastic deformation on the tooth surfaces. Mechatronics System Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance Case Study Tutorial
The patterns of pitch and rhythm variations, as well as the locations where abnormal sounds originate, can help pinpoint the exact location of the fault and assess the extent of the damage. ① A high-pitched, screeching noise usually indicates air intake; if you hear cavitation sounds, it could mean the oil filter is clogged with contaminants. The hydraulic pump's oil suction pipe is loose, the seal is damaged or missing, or the oil level in the tank is too low. Additionally, factors such as degraded and contaminated hydraulic oil, or reduced foam-breaking performance, may also contribute to the issue. ② A ""hissing"" or ""gushing"" sound indicates a significant oil or gas leak at the drain port or leakage point. ③ The ""嗒嗒"" sound indicates poor engagement of the solenoid in the AC solenoid valve, possibly due to contaminants like paint flakes blocking the gap between the movable and stationary iron cores, or perhaps because the push rod is too long. ④ Rough, heavy noise is often caused by overload in the hydraulic pump or hydraulic cylinder. ⑤ The ""chirping"" or ""clucking"" sound from the hydraulic pump is often caused by damaged pump bearings, severe wear on the pump shaft, or air being drawn into the system. ⑥ A sharp, short friction sound often indicates dry friction between two contacting surfaces—or it could also mean that the area has been strained. Chapter 3: Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Hydraulic Systems 77 ⑦ The impact sound is low and muffled, often caused by loose screws inside the hydraulic cylinder or by foreign objects colliding with it. (3) Touch. Gently feel the moving parts that are permitted to be touched, to assess their operational condition. To check for temperature rise, touch the surfaces of the hydraulic pump, oil tank, and valve components with your hand. If it feels hot to the touch after just 2 seconds of contact, you should investigate the cause of the excessive heat. Touch for vibration—gently feel the vibration of moving parts and pipelines. If you detect high-frequency vibrations, check to identify the underlying cause. Three times, while the workbench is moving at low speed under light load, feel with your hand to check for any crawling motion. Check the tightness by feeling with your hands the stopper, microswitch, and tightening screws, among other components. Five-point touch for wear assessment: Run your fingers over the worn components of hydraulic elements to evaluate the extent of wear, scoring, and damage. If your fingers feel smooth when touching the surface of the worn part, it indicates abrasive wear; if you notice a sharp, snagging sensation, it suggests adhesive wear. (4) Smell. Use your sense of smell to determine if the fluid has developed a foul, rancid odor or if rubber components are emitting a peculiar smell due to overheating. If you detect a ""burnt"" oil aroma, it could indicate that the hydraulic pump or hydraulic motor is experiencing cavitation—caused by air being drawn into the system—which generates intense heat and subsequently chars the surrounding oil. Additionally, if the hydraulic oil emits a strong, unpleasant stench or an acrid, pungent odor, this signals that the oil has become severely degraded. Pollution—this item can no longer be used. Check the work environment for any unusual odors to determine whether electrical component insulation has burned out, among other potential issues."

1.4 Mechanical Equipment Maintenance Procedures and Implementation With the continuous advancement of new materials, processes, and technologies, repairing mechanical parts has evolved beyond simply restoring them to their original condition. Many advanced techniques now not only revive components but also enhance their performance and extend their service life. For instance, methods such as electroplating, surfacing welding, application of wear-resistant coatings, thermal spraying and flame spraying, adhesive bonding, and various surface-hardening treatments allow for the precise deposition of small amounts of high-performance materials onto part surfaces—at relatively low costs—while significantly boosting wear resistance.

Corrosion is the process by which metals are damaged as a result of interactions with their surrounding environment, typically occurring when metal components undergo chemical or electrochemical reactions under specific environmental conditions. Corrosive damage always begins at the metal’s surface, gradually progressing inward—sometimes rapidly, sometimes more slowly—leading to material loss, degradation of surface quality, and even internal crystal structure damage. This ultimately results in irregularly shaped defects such as pits and spots, severely compromising the component’s integrity and eventually causing it to fail. Metal corrosion is broadly classified into two main categories based on its mechanism and underlying processes: chemical corrosion and electrochemical corrosion. Chemical Corrosion of Metal Parts Chemical corrosion of metals is caused by purely chemical reactions. When the surface material of a metal part interacts chemically with harmful components present in surrounding gases or non-electrolytic liquids, a corrosion layer forms on the metal surface. As this layer continuously flakes off and regenerates, the part gradually deteriorates. The primary harmful substances that react chemically with mechanical components include gases like O₂, H₂S, and SO₂, as well as certain corrosive byproducts found in lubricating oils. Among these, the chemical reaction between iron and oxygen is the most common form of chemical corrosion. Erosion, the process is as follows.
4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃ 3Fe + 2O₂ → Fe₃O₄ Corrosion products such as Fe₂O₃ or Fe₃O₄ typically form a protective film that coats the metal surface. During friction, Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment 21 After the surface oxide film is worn away, the friction surface quickly reacts with the oxidizing medium, forming a new oxide layer that is subsequently removed during the friction  process. This cyclical process ultimately leads to metal corrosion. A key characteristic of oxidative wear is the presence of uniform, fine grooves aligned along the sliding direc tion on the friction surface, accompanied by reddish-brown flaky Fe₂O₃ or grayish-black filamentous Fe₃O₄ debris. Debris is generated. The primary factors influencing oxidative wea r are the density and integrity of the oxide film, as well as how firmly it adheres to the substrate. If the oxide film is dense, intact, free of pores, and strongly bonded to the  metal substrate, it exhibits excellent wear resistance, resists being worn away easily, and effectively helps prevent corrosion of the metal surface. 2. Electrochemical Corrosion o f Metal Parts Electrochemical corrosion is a complex physical and chemical process of corrosion. It can be defined as the continuous, charge-driven chemical corrosion that occurs w hen two metal electrodes with a potential difference are immersed in an electrolyte solution. This type of corrosion happens when metals come into contact with electrolytic substan ces, and its key distinction from ordinary chemical corrosion lies in the fact that it involves the flow of electric current during the process. The fundamental conditions necessar y for electrochemical corrosion to occur are: ① the presence of two or more objects with differing electrode potentials—or, within a single object, regions exhibiting different ele ctrode potentials—that act as positive and negative electrodes; ② a conductive pathway connecting the electrodes, either through a conductor or direct contact, allowing charges in  the corrosion zone to flow freely; and ③ the simultaneous presence of an electrolyte solution. Common forms of electrochemical corrosion include the following: (1) Uniform corrosio n. When a metal part or component exhibits a uniform corrosion pattern across its surface, it is referred to as uniform corrosion. This type of corrosion can occur in liquids, the  atmosphere, or soil. Among mechanical equipment, the most common form of uniform corrosion is atmospheric corrosion. In industrial areas, the atmosphere often contains higher conce ntrations of corrosive gases such as CO₂, SO₂, H₂S, NO₂, and Cl₂. Additionally, airborne dust particles may carry acidic, alkaline, or saline micro-particles, which, when adhering  to the surface of components, can absorb moisture from the air and form an electrolyte, ultimately leading to corrosion on the part's surface. (2) Pitting corrosion. On most surfac es of metal components, corrosion either doesn’t occur at all or is very mild; however, localized areas develop small corrosion pits that penetrate deeply into the material. This t ype of corrosion is known as pitting corrosion. Because metals used in industry often contain extremely tiny microelectrodes, they are highly susceptible to pitting corrosion when  exposed to aqueous solutions or humid environments. In the case of steel components, when pitting corrosion occurs alongside uniform corrosion, the corrosion spots can easily becom e obscured by the porous structure formed during uniform corrosion, making them difficult to detect and identify. As a result, pitting corrosion is one of the most dangerous forms  of corrosion. (3) Crevice corrosion. In机电 equipment, gaps exist between various connected components—typically ranging from 0.025 to 0.1 mm. When corrosive media enter these gaps a nd remain trapped, localized corrosion can occur precisely at the crevices. For instance, this type of crevice corrosion often happens at flange faces where pipes are connected, as  well as at the riveted joints of metal rivets. (4) Corrosion Fatigue. When metallic components subjected to cyclic stress experience reduced fatigue strength or shortened fatigue  life—and ultimately fail—due to the presence of a corrosive environment, this phenomenon is known as corrosion fatigue or corrosion fatigue fracture. Corrosion fatigue can cause me tal components to fracture even under very low levels of cyclic (pulsating) stress, and often there is no clear fatigue limit. As a result, damage caused by corrosion fatigue tends  to be more severe than that resulting from pure mechanical fatigue alone. To prevent and reduce corrosion failures, as well as minimize their harmful effects on equipment, special  attention must be paid during the manufacturing process to correctly selecting materials for components and thoughtfully designing various structural elements. Additionally, for p arts operating in corrosive environments, advanced anti-corrosion measures such as surface coating technologies, electrochemical protection techniques, and the addition of corrosio n inhibitors should be employed to ensure that these components remain protected—or at least minimally affected—by corrosive agents."

3. Cavitation When a part comes into contact wi th a liquid and experiences relative motion, bubbles form at the contact point if the local pressure drops below the liquid's vapor pressure.

This is usually due to deformation of the parts, particularly It is caused by the deformation of basic components, which disrupts the positional accuracy between parts and, in turn, affects the relationships among the individual components. Deformation in mechanical parts or components can be categorized into two types: elastic deformation and plastic deformation. Elastic Deformation Elastic deformation is the type of deformation that fully recovers once the external force is removed. After a material undergoes elastic deformation, it may exhibit an elastic aftereffect: when the external force is suddenly released, the strain doesn’t vanish entirely right away—it disappears only partially, with the remaining portion gradually dissipating over time. This phenomenon, where the strain lags behind the applied stress, is known as the elastic aftereffect. The extent of the elastic aftereffect depends on factors such as the material’s properties, the magnitude of the stress, its initial state, and the temperature. Specifically, the more non-uniform the metal’s microstructure, the greater the applied stress, and the higher the temperature, the more pronounced the elastic aftereffect will be. Typically, after straightening, shaft-like components tend to bend again after some time—this is a clear manifestation of the elastic aftereffect. To eliminate this phenomenon, one effective method is to perform prolonged tempering, which ensures that residual stresses are completely relieved within a short period. Plastic Deformation Plastic deformation refers to the type of deformation that does not fully recover once the external force is removed. Its key characteristics include: ① it leads to changes in the material's microstructure and properties, resulting in work hardening of the metal; ② since polycrystalline materials undergo uneven deformation across individual grains and even within the same grain during plastic deformation, the elastic recovery of each grain differs after the external force is removed, leading to residual stresses; ③ plastic deformation enhances atomic mobility, thereby reducing the metal's corrosion resistance. Plastic deformation of metal parts, viewed from macroscopic morphological features, includes volume deformation, warping deformation, and aging deformation. Volume deformation refers to the phenomenon where metal parts expand or contract in volume due to changes in thermal capacity caused by phase transformations during heating and cooling processes. Warping deformation, on the other hand, involves plastic deformation that results in bending or twisting of the part, with the primary cause being failures outlined in Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance. 23 It involves deformations of various types (such as bending, torsion, tension-compression, etc.) and in different directions. These deformations are commonly observed in slender shaft-like, thin plate-shaped components, as well as in thin-walled annular and sleeve-type parts. Age-related deformation is caused by changes in stress. 3. Measures to Prevent and Reduce Deformation of Mechanical Parts Deformation is inevitable, but appropriate measures can be taken from the following four areas to prevent and minimize mechanical part deformation. 1) Design aspect
1.3.4 Fracture of Mechanical Parts Fracture refers to the phenomenon where a mechanical component develops localized cracks or splits into several parts under the influence of certain factors. It is one of the primary modes of mechanical component failure—once a part fractures, it not only completely loses its functionality but can also lead to significant economic losses and even cause accidents resulting in injuries or fatalities. Particularly as modern manufacturing systems continue to evolve toward higher power levels and faster rotational speeds, the operating conditions for components have changed dramatically, increasing the likelihood of fracture-related failures. As a result, fracture failure has become a hot topic of research today. The fracture surface formed after a part breaks can accurately capture the dynamic evolution of the failure process. By analyzing the fracture surface, it is possible to identify the primary cause of the fracture, providing valuable insights that help refine designs and enable effective repairs. Based on the cause of failure, fractures can be categorized into types such as brittle fracture and fatigue fracture. Brittle Fracture Before fracturing, the component exhibits no noticeable plastic deformation; this type of fracture, which develops extremely rapidly, is known as brittle fracture.  Brittle fracture occurs without any prior warning signs, making it a sudden and highly dangerous form of failure. Metal parts may become brittle—and thus prone to sudden fracture— due to improper manufacturing processes, exposure to corrosive media during use, or adverse environmental conditions. For instance, the penetration of hydrogen or hydrides into met al materials can lead to  ""hydrogen embrittlement, "" while chloride ions infiltrating austenitic stainless steel may cause  ""chloride stress corrosion cracking. "" Similarly, nitrate ions entering carbon steel can trigger  ""nitrate embrittlement, "" and steel in contact with alkaline substances might suffer from  ""alkali embrittlement. "" Additionally, copper components exposed to ammonia can experience  ""ammonia-induced embrittlement. "" Furthermore, at ambient temperatures between 10°C and 15°C, medium- to low-strength carbon steels are particularly susceptible to  ""cold embrittlement "" (often caused by elevated phosphorus content in the steel). Meanwhile, aluminum-containing alloys, if not carefully temperature-controlled during heat treatment, can easily overh eat—even with only a slight deviation from the optimal range—leading to severe embrittlement. The hazards posed by brittle fracture in metals are significant, second only to those  associated with fatigue failure. Fatigue Fracture The fracture phenomenon that occurs in metal parts after being subjected to a certain number of cyclic loads or alternating stresses is known as fatigue failure. In fact, 80% of fractures in mechanical components during use are caused by fatigue. Typically, fatigue failure progresses through three distinct stages: the initiation phase of fatigue cracks; the propagation phase of fatigue cracks; and finally, catastrophic failure—the unstable, rapid growth phase of the fatigue crack. Below, we will analyze the fracture surfaces associated with fatigue failure. A typical fatigue fracture typically exhibits 3 distinct features based on the fracture process. Regions with distinct characteristics: fatigue core zone, fatigue crack propagation Zone and transient zone, as shown in Figure 1.4. Fatigue Core Zone It is the source region of fatigue fracture, visible to the naked eye or under low magnification. A magnifying glass can pinpoint the location of the fatigue core on the fracture surface—it typically does. Appearing in the area with the lowest intensity, highest stress, and closest to the surface Position. But if there are defects inside the material, this fatigue core... It could also occur at the defect site. Scratches left behind during the machining, storage, transportation, and assembly processes are highly likely to become fatigue nuclei, as these marks not only cause stress concentrations but also remain vulnerable to corrosion damage from air and other environmental factors.

8—Back cover; 9—Reset spring seat; 10—Spring; 11—Stopper Figure 3.11: Structure and Operating Principle of the Solenoid Directional Control Valve – A Case Study Tutorial on Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Mechatronic Systems 110 The disassembly and assembly steps for the solenoid directional control valve are as follows. (1) First, disconnect the machine tool's power supply and remove the electrical components (terminals) from the solenoid directional control valve. (2) Use a Phillips screwdriver to remove the solenoid directional control valve, and then detach the side baffles. (3) After removing the springs from both ends, take out the spool of the solenoid directional control valve. 2) Electro-hydraulic directional control valve The structure and appearance of the electro-hydraulic directional control valve are shown in Figure 3.12. 1. 7—Check valve; 2. 6—Throttle valve; 3. 5—Solenoid; 4—Pilot valve spool; 8—Main valve spool Figure 3.12: Structure and Appearance of the Electro-Hydraulic Directional Control Valve The electro-hydraulic directional control valve is composed of a solenoid-operated directional valve and a hydraulically actuated directional valve combined together. The solenoid valve is responsible for switching the flow direction in the control oil circuits connected to both ends of the hydraulically actuated valve, thereby changing the working position of the valve spool—this component is referred to as the pilot valve. Meanwhile, the hydraulically actuated directional valve controls the reversing of the actuator elements within the system and is thus called the main valve. This operating mechanism allows a small electromagnetic force to manage the high-flow switching of the main oil circuit, making it ideal for hydraulic systems requiring large flow rates. As shown in Figure 3.12(a), the structure of the electro-hydraulic directional valve features a three-position, four-way Y-type solenoid valve at the top as the pilot valve, while the main valve below is a three-position, four-way O-type hydraulically actuated directional valve. The centering method for the spool of the three-position, four-way electro-hydraulic directional valve can be either spring-centered or hydraulically centered. When using spring-centering, the pilot valve should be a Y-type, three-position, four-way solenoid directional valve to ensure that, when the main spool is in the neutral position, the control oil chambers on both sides remain continuously connected to the reservoir, maintaining zero pressure. This setup allows the main spool to stay perfectly centered solely under the influence of the spring force. On the other hand, if hydraulic centering is employed, the pilot valve must be a P-type, three-position, four-way solenoid directional valve to guarantee that, in the neutral position, both control oil chambers of the main spool are always pressurized. Additionally, the electro-hydraulic directional valve offers two options for controlling the oil supply to its control circuit: internal oil supply and external oil supply. In the case of internal oil supply, the control circuit draws pressure oil directly from the main oil line via port P—this is known as internal control. For external oil supply, an independent oil source is typically required, which is referred to as external control. Similarly, the return path for the control circuit can also follow either an internal return (internal leakage) or an external return (external leakage), as illustrated in Figure 3.12(b).
2. Speed Relay A speed relay, also known as a reverse-connection braking relay, works in conjunction with a contactor to enable braking of an electric motor. The speed relay consists of three main components: the stator, the rotor, and the contacts. The rotor of the speed relay is a permanent magnet, directly connected to the shaft of the motor being controlled. The stator is fixed to a mounting bracket, constructed from stacked silicon steel laminations and equipped with a squirrel-cage winding. When the motor shaft rotates, the rotor spins along with it, generating a rotating magnetic field within the air gap surrounding the rotor. This induced rotating field, in turn, generates currents within the squirrel-cage winding—currents that increase in magnitude as the rotor speed rises. The magnetic field produced by these induced currents interacts with the rotating magnetic field, creating a torque on the stator that acts in the same direction as the rotor’s rotation. Consequently, the higher the rotor speed, the greater the resulting torque. When the rotor is stationary, the stator remains in a stable central position due to the gravitational force acting on the stator holder. Once the rotor starts rotating, the stator experiences a torque that causes it to turn in the same direction as the rotor. The higher the rotor speed, the greater the clockwise torque exerted on the stator, resulting in a larger rotational angle. After the stator reaches a certain angle, the normally closed contacts open, while the normally open contacts close. When the shaft speed drops close to zero (below 100 r/min), the contacts automatically reset to their original positions. Commonly used speed relays include the JY1 series and the JF20 series. The JY1 series can reliably operate at speeds up to 3600 r/min, whereas the JF20-1 model is suitable for applications with speeds ranging from 300 to 1000 r/min, and the JF20-2 model is designed for speeds between 1000 and 3600 r/min. Typically, the relay resets when the speed drops to around 120 r/min. Common faults, their underlying causes, and recommended repair methods for speed relays are summarized in Table 5.3. Table 5.3: Common Faults of Speed Relays, Their Causes, and Repair Methods
(3) The mechanical properties of the repair layer—such as its strength and hardness—as well  as the bond strength between the repair layer and the component, and the changes in surface strength of the part after repair—are critical indicators for evaluating repair quality  and serve as the basis for selecting the appropriate restoration technique. (4) Consider the operating conditions and requirements of the mechanical parts. When selecting a repair  technique, the working condition of the part should be taken into account. For example, For example, when mechanical parts operate under rolling conditions, the contact surfaces between the two components experience high contact stresses, making repair techniques like chrome plating, spray welding, and overlay welding particularly suitable. In contrast, when mechanical parts function under sliding conditions—where contact stresses are lower—the range of applicable repair technologies becomes much broader. When selecting a repair technique, it’s important to consider whether the mechanical part can still meet operational requirements after restoration. For instance, if the chosen repair method involves high temperatures during application—such as gas welding or electric welding—it may cause annealing of the mechanical component, compromising the original surface’s heat-treated properties and increasing thermal deformation and residual stresses. Techniques like patch welding or buildup welding, which involve high-temperature processes, are therefore best suited only for non-quenched parts, components that undergo post-weld machining or reshaping, or parts requiring subsequent heat treatment after welding. (5) Consider production feasibility. When selecting repair technologies, it’s essential to take into account the practicality of production, aligning the choice with the existing equipment in the company’s repair workshop, the current level of repair expertise, and the efficiency of the repair production management system. (6) Consider cost-effectiveness. When selecting a repair technique, economic factors should be taken into account. The repair cost of the part and the extended service life after repair should be combined to comprehensively evaluate and measure the economic viability of the chosen repair method. When selecting a parts repair process, it’s essential to consider multiple factors comprehensively rather than focusing on just one aspect. On one hand, you must evaluate the technical requirements of the part being repaired; on the other hand, you should assess the specific characteristics of the repair process itself. Additionally, it’s crucial to align the chosen method with your company’s existing repair capabilities and technical expertise. By doing so, you can ensure the process is both technically sound, economically viable, and practically feasible—ultimately leading to the optimal repair solution. 1.4.6 Methods for Repairing Mechanical Parts 1. Repair Dimension Method For certain mating dimensions, wear and other factors can alter the nature of the fit, leading to component failure. In such cases, cutting processes or other methods can be employed to restore the shape accuracy, positional accuracy, surface roughness, and other technical specifications of the worn areas on the primary part. Meanwhile, the complementary, simpler component—whether a new part manufactured to the correct dimensions while maintaining its original fit characteristics, or a repaired version—is produced accordingly. The dimension obtained after this reconditioning process is referred to as the ""repair size."" This approach is economically advantageous and ensures consistent quality since it involves machining directly on the existing component. However, it does reduce the strength and rigidity of the part, and it also necessitates replacing or repairing the mating component, thereby complicating the interchangeability of parts. The repair dimensioning method is primarily used to restore parts with relatively complex structures, while the corresponding complementary part is typically simpler—such as journal bearings, transmission threads, keyways, or sliding guides. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment 39 2. Inlaying Component Method After localized wear of a part, and provided the structure and strength allow, add a component to compensate for the portion removed due to wear or repair, thereby restoring the original dimensions and precision. 3. Local Repair and Replacement Method The localized repair and replacement method restores a part's functionality by addressing worn or damaged areas through techniques such as local repairs, adjustments, repositioning, or partial replacements. 4. Plastic Deformation Method By leveraging the plastic deformation properties of metallic materials, this method allows excess material from non-functional areas of a part to be redistributed onto worn regions under specific external forces, thereby restoring the part’s original shape and dimensions.

These include casting fluidity (how well molten material flows into molds) and shrinkage (volume reduction during solidification), forging ductility (ability to deform without cracking) and cold-heading capability (suitability for forming at room temperature). Weldability characteristics must be assessed, particularly susceptibility to cold and hot cracking during welding operations. Machinability is crucial for determining how easily the material can be cut and shaped, while heat-treatment properties encompass hardenability (depth of hardening achievable) and resistance to cold brittleness (fragility at low temperatures). All these factors collectively determine how suitable a material is for the intended manufacturing processes and final application.",text-EN.txt,35,,,"Material selection requires consideration of the nature and characteristics of the part’s function and should be based on fundamental wear characteristics, prioritizing high fatigue strength, excellent corrosion resistance, superior wear and high-temperature performance.","Triplets:

Context:  
The defined object. This refers to a single machine, a system composed of several individual machines, or a specific component on the equipment. Different objects may experience varying failure conditions at the same time. For instance, on an automated production line, the failure of a single machine can be enough to disable the entire system; however, in a workshop with a clustered machine layout, the failure of one machine would not necessarily be linked to a breakdown affecting the entire workshop. Time-to-failure. This refers to the fact that the probability of a failure increases as time goes on. In addition to using direct units like years, months, days, or hours, time can also be measured by the number of equipment operations, mileage, or cycles. For instance, vehicles typically use total miles driven as their unit of measurement, while gears might be measured by the number of load-bearing cycles they endure. The specified conditions. These refer to the operational and maintenance conditions during equipment operation, the skill level of personnel, environmental factors, and more. Different conditions will lead to different types of failures. The specified function. It depends on the particular issue at hand. For example, in a lathe operating in the same state, damage to the feed screw would be considered a malfunction when it comes to threading operations—but not when machining end faces, since the two scenarios require different functional capabilities from the lathe. A certain degree of failure. This refers to assessing the severity of functional loss from a quantitative perspective. In production practice, to encompass all possible events, a broad definition of failure has been established: ""A failure is an unqualified state."" 1.1.2 Classification of Failures Mechanical and electrical equipment failures can be categorized from various perspectives, with each classification method highlighting a different aspect of the fault. The purpose of categorizing failures is to assess the severity of the incident, analyze its root causes, and ultimately enable more effective, tailored responses to address the specific types of malfunctions. By examining factors such as failure nature, underlying causes, and distinctive characteristics, faults can be grouped into the following categories. By fault nature (1) Intermittent failures. The equipment temporarily loses certain functions, with the faults often caused by external factors affecting the mechanical and electrical systems—such as operator error, climate changes, or inadequate environmental conditions. Once the external interference is removed or the equipment undergoes minor repairs and adjustments, its functionality typically resumes. (2) Permanent failure. Once this type of failure occurs, it can only be restored through manual repair; otherwise, the fault will persist indefinitely. Such failures are typically caused by damage to specific components. 2) By Severity of the Fault (1) Localized failure. A specific part of the机电 equipment is malfunctioning, causing that particular component to lose its functionality while other parts continue to operate as intended—essentially, a partial functional breakdown. (2) Systemic Failure. A failure that results in the complete loss of system functionality—though it may initially appear as a malfunction in a specific component, it ultimately prevents the device from performing its intended function altogether. Case Studies in Diagnostics and Maintenance of Mechatronic Systems. 4
6 The procedure for equipment failure management is outlined below. (1) Conduct thorough education and awareness campaigns to ensure that operators and maintenance personnel voluntarily comply with relevant rules and regulations regarding operation, maintenance, inspection, etc., properly use and carefully maintain equipment, and diligently record, compile statistics, and analyze any equipment malfunctions. (2) Based on the company’s actual production conditions, equipment status, and specific features, determine the key areas for equipment failure management. (3) Use monitoring instruments and diagnostic techniques to systematically monitor critical equipment, enabling timely detection of fault indicators and deterioration. Information on equipment condition. Typically, equipment can undergo daily inspections, routine patrols, and periodic checks (including precision assessments), as well as integrity assessments—using human senses and common diagnostic tools—to closely monitor the technical status and any unusual signs in components, mechanisms, and areas prone to failure. At the same time, inspection standards should be established to clearly define the boundaries between normal operation, abnormalities, and equipment failures. (4) To quickly locate the fault location and its cause, in addition to providing training to ensure that maintenance and operational staff acquire a solid understanding of electrical and hydraulic technologies, it is also essential to compile common equipment failure symptoms, analysis procedures, and troubleshooting methods into a fault-finding logic flowchart. This will enable operators to swiftly identify the source and root cause of any malfunction after it occurs, allowing for timely diagnosis, repair, and restoration of equipment functionality. (5) Improve the fault recording system. Fault records serve as the foundational data for effective fault management and also provide the original basis for conducting fault analysis and troubleshooting. Records must be complete and accurate. After on-site inspections and fault repairs, maintenance personnel should follow the ""Equipment Carefully complete the  ""Equipment Failure Repair Form "" and submit monthly statistical analyses to the equipment management department. (6) Conduct timely statistics and analysis of equipment failures. In addition to monitoring failur e situations on a daily basis, staff members should compile  ""Failure Repair Forms "" and maintenance records on a monthly basis. By systematically collecting, organizing, and analyzing failure data, it’s possible to calculate the failure frequency and mean time b etween failures for each type of equipment. Furthermore, this process allows for an in-depth analysis of individual equipment failure trends and identifies key root causes, helping  to pinpoint recurring patterns. Armed with this insight, teams can prioritize their response strategies effectively. Finally, the compiled and analyzed failure information should  be shared back with the planning department, enabling them to schedule preventive maintenance or implement improvement measures. This data can also serve as a valuable reference fo r adjusting the intervals, content, and standards of routine inspections. (7) Implement different countermeasures based on the nature of the failure, the type of fault, and the spe cific characteristics of the equipment. For newly acquired equipment, strengthen management during the initial phase of use—carefully monitor and document the equipment’s precision , performance, and any emerging defects from the outset. During operation, emphasize routine maintenance, regular patrol inspections, and periodic checks to promptly identify early  warning signs and take appropriate adjustment or troubleshooting actions. For critical equipment, conduct condition monitoring and diagnostics. Establish a flexible and responsive  maintenance team equipped with advanced technical expertise, employing rapid repair techniques such as component-by-component fixes or group-based replacements. Ensure timely avai lability of high-quality spare parts, leverage production downtime for equipment overhauls, and apply measures like retrofitting or replacing components when wear patterns have bee n thoroughly understood. (8) Carry out routine maintenance tasks effectively to control equipment failures. Utilize status information and early warning signs of potential issues g athered during daily rounds by regional maintenance workers, as well as scheduled equipment condition checks, along with relevant records and analysis data. Based on the specific c haracteristics of each type of equipment and the general defects already identified, the workshop’s equipment mechanic (technician) or maintenance team leader should promptly sched ule routine repairs—ideally during production downtime or weekend slots—to proactively address problems before they escalate, thereby minimizing breakdowns. For certain failure ind icators or hidden risks that exceed the scope of routine maintenance, these should be reported back to the planning department for scheduling dedicated, planned maintenance activit ies instead. (9) Establish a rational fault information management flowchart.
1.1.5 Key Factors Influencing Failure Generation The more complex the mechanical and electrical equipment, the more diverse the potential causes of failure. The main factors influencing these failures include the following aspects. 1) Design Planning In the design planning phase, accurate estimates of the equipment's future operating conditions are essential, and potential variations should be thoroughly considered. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance 7 Consideration: Imperfect design solutions and inadequate review of design drawings and technical documents are major causes of failures. 2) Material Selection In design, manufacturing, and maintenance, it is essential to correctly select materials based on the nature and characteristics of the part’s function. Improper material selection, failure to meet specified material standards, or the use of inappropriate substitutes are major causes of phenomena such as wear, corrosion, excessive deformation, fatigue, cracking, and aging. Additionally, during manufacturing and repair processes, many materials undergo various fabrication steps, including casting, forging, welding, and heat treatment. Throughout these processes, the microstructure and mechanical/physical properties of the materials often undergo significant changes—among which the effects of heating and cooling are particularly critical. 3) Manufacturing Quality Errors exist in every step of the manufacturing process. The variability in process conditions and material properties inevitably leads to differences among parts during casting, Stress concentrations, local defects, and microscopic cracks—such as those arising during forging, welding, heat treatment, and machining—are common issues. These flaws are often overlooked during process inspections. As a result, the manufacturing quality of parts frequently fails to meet requirements, which is a major reason behind the short lifespan of mechanical equipment. 4) Assembly Quality First, there must be proper fit requirements. The tolerance limits for the clearance include the initial clearance that remains after assembly and running-in. If the initial clearance is too large, the effective service life will be shortened. Additionally, the positional accuracy between individual components during assembly is critical—failure to meet these specifications can lead to additional stresses, uneven wear, and ultimately accelerate component failure. 5) Proper Maintenance
Due to various reasons, the early failure period may reappear after major equipment repairs or upgrades. 2. Random Failure Period During the random failure period, the failure rate remains low and stable, nearly constant. Random failures are caused by偶然 factors—they are unpredictable and cannot be eliminated even by extending the running-in phase. Design flaws, component defects, inadequate maintenance, and improper operation can all lead to random failures. 3. Wear-Out Failure Phase The characteristic of wear-out failures is that the failure rate increases as operating time accumulates. Wear-out failures are caused by factors such as wear fatigue, aging, and corrosion of equipment components. These types of failures typically indicate that the equipment is approaching its major overhaul period or nearing the end of its service life. 1.3 Failure Modes of Mechanical Components and Corresponding Countermeasures During equipment operation, the phenomenon where mechanical components lose their intended functionality due to various factors such as design, materials, manufacturing processes, and assembly—rendering them unable to continue working—is referred to as failure. When critical components of machinery fail, it indicates that the equipment has entered a state of malfunction. Machine failures are inherently linked to the failure of mechanical parts. Given the wide variety of mechanical equipment types, along with significant differences in operating conditions and environmental factors, the failure modes of mechanical components also vary widely. Among these, the four most common and representative failure modes are wear, corrosion, deformation, and fracture. 1.3.1 Wear of Mechanical Components Wear of mechanical components is the primary failure mode for parts. In typical mechanical equipment, approximately 80% of failed or scrapped components are due to wear-related issues. Wear not only reduces the efficiency and reliability of机电设备 but can also lead to premature failure of the equipment itself. Therefore, conducting research into the wear mechanisms of机电设备 can help us understand the specific wear characteristics of various components, providing a solid foundation for developing effective maintenance strategies and schedules—and ultimately extending the service life of the equipment. 1. General Patterns of Part Wear Wear is a microscopic and dynamic process that occurs as parts wear down. Various physical, chemical, and mechanical phenomena occur, along with their external manifestations. The state refers to the wear of the surface material, and the extent of wear is typically measured by abrasion. Measure, measure. Under normal operating conditions, the wear process of the part is divided into 3 stages. Phase, as shown in Figure 1.3, where w represents the wear amount. 1) Fitting-in Phase OA It occurs during the initial phase of equipment use. At this stage, the surfaces of the friction pair exhibit micro-… Observing the wave peaks results in a smaller actual contact area between the parts, leading to increased contact stress. Very large, resulting in plastic deformation and wear at the surface of the running parts at a rapid rate.
According to theoretical studies on wear, combined with practical production experience, the methods and approaches t o prevent or reduce wear can be summarized into the following areas. Lubrication Choosing the right lubricant and lubrication method, and replacing dry friction with ideal fluid friction, is the most effective way to reduce friction and wear. Correctly selecting materials Selecting the right materials based on their fundamental wear characteristics is one of the key factors in enhancing wear resistance. High fatigue strength, excellent corrosion resistance, and superior wear and high-temperature performance should be prioritized when choosing new steel grades or advanced materials. Additionally, it’s important to consider the compatibility between mating materials to ensure they form an optimal combination.

Additionally, the positional accuracy between individual components during assembly is critical—failure to meet these specifications can lead to additional stresses, uneven wear, and ultimately accelerate component failure. 5) Proper Maintenance
When designing, it's essential to consider not only the strength of the parts but also their stiffness, as well as issues related to manufacturing, assembly, usage, disassembly, and maintenance. (1) Select materials carefully, paying attention to their process properties—such as casting fluidity and shrinkage, forging ductility and cold-heading capability, weldability characteristics like susceptibility to cold and hot cracking, machinability for ease of cutting, and heat-treatment properties including hardenability and resistance to cold brittleness. (2) Properly arrange the parts to optimize their stress distribution. Select appropriate structural dimensions, ensuring uniform wall thicknesses as much as possible, and minimize deformation during hot working processes. For instance, avoid sharp corners by replacing them with rounded or chamfered edges; for areas with significant thickness variations, consider adding process holes or reinforcing excessively thin sections. Additionally, carefully position any existing holes—transforming blind holes into through-holes where feasible. For parts with complex geometries, whenever possible, opt for modular or assembled designs to further enhance stress management. (3) In the design process, ensure the application of new technologies, processes, and materials to minimize internal stresses and deformation during manufacturing. 2) Manufacturing In the rough casting manufacturing process, it is important to address deformation issues and implement various process measures to minimize residual stresses in the blank. After the raw parts are produced and during subsequent machining processes, it is essential to incorporate sufficient steps for relieving internal stresses, aiming to minimize residual stresses within the components. One effective method to eliminate these residuals is through aging treatment, which can be either natural or artificial. Natural aging involves leaving the finished raw parts exposed outdoors for 1 to 2 years. This approach leverages the material’s inherent property of gradually releasing internal stresses over a period of 12 to 20 months—making it particularly effective—but the main drawback is the excessively long aging cycle. On the other hand, artificial aging accelerates the stress-relief process by subjecting the parts to high-temperature annealing followed by controlled cooling at a slow pace. Alternatively, vibrational techniques can also be employed to achieve artificial aging. For high-precision components, artificial aging must be integrated into the final machining stages to ensure optimal dimensional accuracy and stability. During machining and repair processes, minimize the number of datum shifts, preserving the original machining datums for use during maintenance, thereby reducing repair time. Errors caused by inconsistent benchmarks during machining. For parts that have undergone heat treatment, be sure to allow sufficient machining allowances and adjust the machining dimensions accordingly. Pre-applying controlled deformation is crucial—once the deformation patterns of the part are understood, you can counteract them in advance by introducing an equal but opposite amount of deformation. Alternatively, you can pre-stress the part or carefully manage the generation and evolution of stresses, ensuring that the final deformation aligns with specifications and effectively minimizes distortion. 3) Maintenance Aspects During maintenance, it is essential to not only meet the technical requirements—such as restoring part dimensions, ensuring proper fit tolerances, and achieving high surface quality—but also to inspect and correct any shape or positional errors in critical components. To minimize stress and deformation of parts during repair, standardized guidelines and maintenance procedures specifically addressing deformation issues should be established. Additionally, simple, reliable, and user-friendly specialized measuring tools and fixtures should be designed. Finally, it’s important to actively promote ""three new"" technologies, particularly innovative repair techniques like brush plating and bonding. 4) Usage Instructions
1.4.1 Preparations Before Mechanical Equipment Maintenance Electromechanical equipment occupies a critically important position in the production and operational activities of modern industrial enterprises. To ensure smooth equipment operation and safe production, implementing planned preventive maintenance is an essential component of equipment management and repair practices in industrial companies. This section will cover the detailed process of major equipment overhauls, the determination of equipment repair plans, as well as the technical and material preparations required prior to equipment maintenance. 1. Equipment Major Overhaul Process To ensure the precision and operational performance of mechanical and electrical equipment, preventive scheduled maintenance must be carried out in addition to routine upkeep. Among these preventive measures, major overhauls stand out as a critical task aimed at restoring the equipment's accuracy. Within the category of preventive maintenance, major overhauls—often referred to simply as ""overhauls""—represent the most extensive and time-consuming type of repair. An overhaul involves completely or largely disassembling the equipment, repairing or replacing foundational components, refurbishing mechanical and electrical parts, recalibrating the electrical systems, and finally reassembling and fine-tuning the entire unit. The ultimate goal is to thoroughly eliminate any pre-existing defects and restore the equipment to its specified performance standards. The purpose of precision and performance. The major steps involved in the overhaul of mechanical and electrical equipment typically include: pre-disassembly unit inspection, component removal, component inspection, necessary component disassembly, parts cleaning and examination, component repair and assembly, final assembly, no-load trial operation, load testing, overall machine precision verification, and final acceptance. In practice, these tasks should be carried out according to the overhaul work plan, while also ensuring effective job scheduling, quality control during operations, and thorough completion acceptance. The major overhaul process for mechanical and electrical equipment is typically divided into three stages: pre-repair preparation, the repair process itself, and post-repair acceptance. Pre-repair preparation phase To ensure the repair work proceeds smoothly and accurately, maintenance personnel should carefully listen to operators' requirements for equipment repairs and thoroughly understand the issues affecting the equipment being serviced—such as loss of precision, the extent of wear on major mechanical components, the accuracy of the transmission system, and any visible defects. They should also identify which parts need improvement or modification to meet the equipment’s operational specifications. Additionally, they should review relevant technical documentation, equipment manuals, and previous maintenance records to become familiar with the device’s structural features, transmission system, and original design precision standards. This preparation will enable them to propose comprehensive pre-inspection tasks. Following the pre-inspection, specific repair methods for critical and large components can be determined, allowing for the preparation of specialized tools and precision measuring instruments. Finally, the team must define the post-repair precision testing procedures and establish clear acceptance criteria for trial runs, ensuring all technical preparations are fully in place before proceeding with the complete overhaul of the equipment.
Particularly important
General Principles for Disassembly (1) Based on the structural characteristics of the mechanical equipment, select a logical disassembly sequence. Typically, the process involves dismantling from the overall unit into subassemblies, then breaking down subassemblies into individual components, and finally separating components into their constituent parts—or alternatively, proceeding from accessories to the main unit and from external elements inward. When disassembling particularly complex components, it’s essential to thoroughly study the assembly drawings and carefully analyze the component’s structure as well as the specific roles its parts play within the assembly. Pay special attention to components that require high precision during assembly. This approach helps prevent confusion, ensures an orderly disassembly process, and ultimately facilitates cleaning, inspection, and identification—laying a solid foundation for effective maintenance work. (2) Rational disassembly. During the maintenance and disassembly of mechanical equipment, adhere to the principle of avoiding unnecessary disassembly while ensuring that components requiring removal are indeed taken apart. (3) Use disassembly tools and equipment correctly. After understanding the steps involved in removing mechanical components, it’s crucial to select and properly apply the appropriate disassembly tools. When dismantling, always opt for specialized or suitably matched tools and equipment whenever possible, avoiding random hammering or forceful techniques to prevent damage or deformation of the parts. For instance, when removing shaft sleeves, rolling bearings, gears, pulleys, and similar components, use pullers or hydraulic presses; and for unscrewing studs or nuts, always prefer wrenches that match their dimensions precisely. Precautions During Disassembly: When performing mechanical equipment maintenance, disassembly should also take into account the subsequent assembly tasks. To ensure a smooth process, keep the following points in mind. (1) Ensure thorough verification or marking of disassembled parts. Mechanical equipment often contains numerous precisely matched components and parts, many of which have been specifically selected or balanced for weight—meaning their assembly positions and orientations must not be altered under any circumstances. Therefore, when dismantling, carefully check parts that already bear original markings. If these markings are unclear, misaligned, or missing altogether, re-mark them exactly as they were originally to ensure proper alignment during reassembly, preventing any confusion or errors. (2) Store parts by category. When storing disassembled parts, follow these principles: Parts belonging to the same type or component should be kept together whenever possible; store items according to their size and precision level; non-interchangeable parts must be stored separately in groups; delicate components that are sensitive to dirt or damage should be removed and stored individually; rubber parts should never be stored alongside oil-bearing components; and ensure that easily lost items are carefully accounted for. Parts such as washers and nuts should be strung together with wire or stored in dedicated containers; all types of studs must be fitted with nuts before being placed in storage. Additionally, parts like steel components, aluminum items, rubber pieces, and leather goods should be stored separately in different containers, categorized by their respective material types. (3) Protect the machined surfaces of removed parts. During disassembly, never damage the machined surfaces of the components being taken apart—doing so could complicate repair work and lead to issues such as air, oil, or water leaks, ultimately resulting in reduced performance of the mechanical equipment. 1.4.4 Disassembly Methods for Commonly Used Components The disassembly of commonly used components should follow general disassembly principles, while also considering their specific characteristics and employing appropriate methods tailored to each component in order to achieve the intended purpose. 1. Disassembly of the Spindle Assembly To prevent reduced assembly accuracy due to improper disassembly, mark the relative positions of bearings, washers, tool housings, and spindles around the circumference during removal. After disassembling, group each bearing along with its corresponding inner and outer washers separately and store them in distinct locations—do not mix them up. Ensure that the workbench and surrounding area at the disassembly site remain clean, and immediately place all removed parts into oil to prevent rusting. When reassembling, be sure to reinstall them according to their original marked orientations. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment"

1.3.4 Fracture of Mechanical Parts Fracture refers to the phenomenon where a mechanical component develops localized cracks or splits into several parts under the influence of certain factors. It is one of the primary modes of mechanical component failure—once a part fractures, it not only completely loses its functionality but can also lead to significant economic losses and even cause accidents resulting in injuries or fatalities. Particularly as modern manufacturing systems continue to evolve toward higher power levels and faster rotational speeds, the operating conditions for components have changed dramatically, increasing the likelihood of fracture-related failures. As a result, fracture failure has become a hot topic of research today. The fracture surface formed after a part breaks can accurately capture the dynamic evolution of the failure process. By analyzing the fracture surface, it is possible to identify the primary cause of the fracture, providing valuable insights that help refine designs and enable effective repairs. Based on the cause of failure, fractures can be categorized into types such as brittle fracture and fatigue fracture. Brittle Fracture Before fracturing, the component exhibits no noticeable plastic deformation; this type of fracture, which develops extremely rapidly, is known as brittle fracture.  Brittle fracture occurs without any prior warning signs, making it a sudden and highly dangerous form of failure. Metal parts may become brittle—and thus prone to sudden fracture— due to improper manufacturing processes, exposure to corrosive media during use, or adverse environmental conditions. For instance, the penetration of hydrogen or hydrides into met al materials can lead to  ""hydrogen embrittlement, "" while chloride ions infiltrating austenitic stainless steel may cause  ""chloride stress corrosion cracking. "" Similarly, nitrate ions entering carbon steel can trigger  ""nitrate embrittlement, "" and steel in contact with alkaline substances might suffer from  ""alkali embrittlement. "" Additionally, copper components exposed to ammonia can experience  ""ammonia-induced embrittlement. "" Furthermore, at ambient temperatures between 10°C and 15°C, medium- to low-strength carbon steels are particularly susceptible to  ""cold embrittlement "" (often caused by elevated phosphorus content in the steel). Meanwhile, aluminum-containing alloys, if not carefully temperature-controlled during heat treatment, can easily overh eat—even with only a slight deviation from the optimal range—leading to severe embrittlement. The hazards posed by brittle fracture in metals are significant, second only to those  associated with fatigue failure. Fatigue Fracture The fracture phenomenon that occurs in metal parts after being subjected to a certain number of cyclic loads or alternating stresses is known as fatigue failure. In fact, 80% of fractures in mechanical components during use are caused by fatigue. Typically, fatigue failure progresses through three distinct stages: the initiation phase of fatigue cracks; the propagation phase of fatigue cracks; and finally, catastrophic failure—the unstable, rapid growth phase of the fatigue crack. Below, we will analyze the fracture surfaces associated with fatigue failure. A typical fatigue fracture typically exhibits 3 distinct features based on the fracture process. Regions with distinct characteristics: fatigue core zone, fatigue crack propagation Zone and transient zone, as shown in Figure 1.4. Fatigue Core Zone It is the source region of fatigue fracture, visible to the naked eye or under low magnification. A magnifying glass can pinpoint the location of the fatigue core on the fracture surface—it typically does. Appearing in the area with the lowest intensity, highest stress, and closest to the surface Position. But if there are defects inside the material, this fatigue core... It could also occur at the defect site. Scratches left behind during the machining, storage, transportation, and assembly processes are highly likely to become fatigue nuclei, as these marks not only cause stress concentrations but also remain vulnerable to corrosion damage from air and other environmental factors.

4. Measures to Reduce Fracture Failure Fracture failure is one of the most dangerous forms of failure, and most metal parts fail due to various factors arising from metallurgy and part manufacturing processes. Because all of them contain cracks of varying sizes and characteristics, ranging from atomic-level dislocations to macroscopic cracks visible to the naked eye. However, a part with cracks doesn’t necessarily fail immediately—there’s typically a period during which these cracks undergo subcritical propagation. Moreover, under certain conditions, cracks may even remain stable without expanding at all. Therefore, by implementing effective measures, it’s possible to ensure that parts containing cracks do not ultimately fracture. Strategies to minimize fracture failures can be considered from the following perspectives. 1) Optimize the shape and structural design of parts, and carefully select appropriate materials for the components. Both geometric discontinuities in part shapes and material imperfections can lead to stress concentration. Geometric discontinuities are commonly referred to as notches, such as fillets at shoulders, grooves, oil holes, keyways, threads, and machining marks. Material-related discontinuities are typically called material defects, including shrinkage porosity, shrinkage cavities, non-metallic inclusions, and welding flaws. These areas prone to stress concentration are particularly susceptible to crack initiation and propagation under cyclic or impact loading, ultimately leading to fracture. Therefore, in part design, it’s crucial to minimize stress-concentration zones while carefully considering the part’s operating environment—such as the presence of corrosive media, temperature variations, and applied loads—and selecting appropriate materials accordingly. This approach helps effectively reduce the risk of fatigue failure. 2) Properly select the part machining method During various machining, welding, and heat treatment processes, residual stresses remain inside components due to factors such as plastic deformation, thermal expansion and contraction, and phase transformations occurring during these operations. Residual stresses are categorized into two types: residual tensile stress and residual compressive stress. While residual tensile stress is detrimental to component performance, residual compressive stress can significantly enhance the fatigue life of the part. Therefore, it is advisable to prioritize processes like carburizing, nitriding, shot peening, and surface rolling—methods known for generating beneficial compressive stresses—in component manufacturing. By inducing compressive stresses on the component’s surface, these techniques help counteract some of the tensile stresses caused by external loads, thereby improving the overall durability and longevity of the part. 3) Installation and Usage Instructions"

2) Fatigue Crack Propagation Zone This region is the most critical feature area on the fracture surface, often appearing shell-like or resembling beach ripples. Each individual line marks the trace left behind after a single crack extension event—typically corresponding to a change in applied load, such as when a machine starts up or shuts down. These lines radiate outward from the fatigue core, advancing perpendicularly to the direction of crack propagation. The smoother the crack propagation zone on the fatigue fracture surface, the more load cycles the component endured prior to failure. Conversely, the denser the shell-like lines near the instantaneous fracture zone indicate lower load magnitudes. On the other hand, if this area appears rougher, it suggests that the crack propagated rapidly under relatively high loading conditions. 3) Transient Break Zone Commonly referred to as the ""static fracture surface,"" it is the fracture region formed when a fatigue crack rapidly propagates upon reaching a critical size. Its macroscopic features closely resemble the radial zone and shear lips typically observed in fast-fracture areas of static tensile fractures. The location and size of the instantaneous fracture zone are directly influenced by the applied load—specifically, the greater the load, the closer the final fracture area moves toward the center of the fracture surface. Conversely, a smaller fracture area indicates that the component was subjected to a lower load."

1.3.4 Fracture of Mechanical Parts Fracture refers to the phenomenon where a mechanical component develops localized cracks or splits into several parts under the influence of certain factors. It is one of the primary modes of mechanical component failure—once a part fractures, it not only completely loses its functionality but can also lead to significant economic losses and even cause accidents resulting in injuries or fatalities. Particularly as modern manufacturing systems continue to evolve toward higher power levels and faster rotational speeds, the operating conditions for components have changed dramatically, increasing the likelihood of fracture-related failures.

(1) The defined object. This refers to a single machine, a system composed of several individual machines, or a specific component on the equipment. Different objects may experience varying failure conditions at the same time. For instance, on an automated production line, the failure of a single machine can be enough to disable the entire system; however, in a workshop with a clustered machine layout, the failure of one machine would not necessarily be linked to a breakdown affecting the entire workshop. (2) Time-to-failure. This refers to the fact that the probability of a failure increases as time goes on. In addition to using direct units like years, months, days, or hours, time can also be measured by the number of equipment operations, mileage, or cycles. For instance, vehicles typically use total miles driven as their unit of measurement, while gears might be measured by the number of load-bearing cycles they endure. (3) The specified conditions. These refer to the operational and maintenance conditions during equipment operation, the skill level of personnel, environmental factors, and more. Different conditions will lead to different types of failures. (4) The specified function. It depends on the particular issue at hand. For example, in a lathe operating in the same state, damage to the feed screw would be considered a malfunction when it comes to threading operations—but not when machining end faces, since the two scenarios require different functional capabilities from the lathe. (5) A certain degree of failure. This refers to assessing the severity of functional loss from a quantitative perspective. In production practice, to encompass all possible events, a broad definition of failure has been established: ""A failure is an unqualified state."" 1.1.2 Classification of Failures Mechanical and electrical equipment failures can be categorized from various perspectives, with each classification method highlighting a different aspect of the fault. The purpose of categorizing failures is to assess the severity of the incident, analyze its root causes, and ultimately enable more effective, tailored responses to address the specific types of malfunctions. By examining factors such as failure nature, underlying causes, and distinctive characteristics, faults can be grouped into the following categories. By fault nature (1) Intermittent failures. The equipment temporarily loses certain functions, with the faults often caused by external factors affecting the mechanical and electrical systems—such as operator error, climate changes, or inadequate environmental conditions. Once the external interference is removed or the equipment undergoes minor repairs and adjustments, its functionality typically resumes. (2) Permanent failure. Once this type of failure occurs, it can only be restored through manual repair; otherwise, the fault will persist indefinitely. Such failures are typically caused by damage to specific components. 2) By Severity of the Fault (1) Localized failure. A specific part of the机电 equipment is malfunctioning, causing that particular component to lose its functionality while other parts continue to operate as intended—essentially, a partial functional breakdown. (2) Systemic Failure. A failure that results in the complete loss of system functionality—though it may initially appear as a malfunction in a specific component, it ultimately prevents the device from performing its intended function altogether.

1.1.5 Key Factors Influencing Failure Generation The more complex the mechanical and electrical equipment, the more diverse the potential causes of failure.

Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance 7 Consideration: Imperfect design solutions and inadequate review of design drawings and technical documents are major causes of failures. 2) Material Selection In design, manufacturing, and maintenance, it is essential to correctly select materials based on the nature and characteristics of the part’s function. Improper material selection, failure to meet specified material standards, or the use of inappropriate substitutes are major causes of phenomena such as wear, corrosion, excessive deformation, fatigue, cracking, and aging. Additionally, during manufacturing and repair processes, many materials undergo various fabrication steps, including casting, forging, welding, and heat treatment. Throughout these processes, the microstructure and mechanical/physical properties of the materials often undergo significant changes—among which the effects of heating and cooling are particularly critical. 3) Manufacturing Quality Errors exist in every step of the manufacturing process. The variability in process conditions and material properties inevitably leads to differences among parts during casting, Stress concentrations, local defects, and microscopic cracks—such as those arising during forging, welding, heat treatment, and machining—are common issues. These flaws are often overlooked during process inspections. As a result, the manufacturing quality of parts frequently fails to meet requirements, which is a major reason behind the short lifespan of mechanical equipment. 4) Assembly Quality First, there must be proper fit requirements. The tolerance limits for the clearance include the initial clearance that remains after assembly and running-in. If the initial clearance is too large, the effective service life will be shortened. Additionally, the positional accuracy between individual components during assembly is critical—failure to meet these specifications can lead to additional stresses, uneven wear, and ultimately accelerate component failure. 5) Proper Maintenance"

16 1. Equipment Fault Diagnosis Process Equipment fault diagnosis encompasses three key areas: condition monitoring, analytical diagnosis, and fault prediction. The specific implementation process can be summarized into the following four steps. 1) Signal Acquisition During operation, equipment inevitably experiences changes in various quantities such as force, heat, vibration, and energy, generating a wide range of distinct information. Depending on specific diagnostic needs, it is crucial to select signals that accurately reflect the equipment's operational status—such as vibration, pressure, or temperature—since these signals are typically captured using different types of sensors. 2) Signal Processing This is the process of classifying and processing the collected signals to extract features that accurately represent the machine's characteristics—also known as feature extraction. For example, transforming a vibration signal from the time domain to the frequency domain for spectral analysis is part of this process. 3) State Recognition The device's characteristic parameters, obtained after signal processing, are compared with the specified allowable or discriminant parameters to determine the device's condition. The current status—whether a fault exists, and if so, its type and nature. To address this, appropriate identification criteria and diagnostic strategies should be carefully developed. 4) Diagnostic Decision-making
The steps for fracture failure analysis are generally as follows. 1) On-site recording and photography After a major equipment accident occurs, promptly investigate and understand all circumstances before and after the incident, and take photographs or videos if necessary. Unless there are casualties requiring immediate attention, efforts should be made to preserve the scene as much as possible. 2) Analyze the dominant failure component When a critical component fails due to fracture, it often leads to the failure of other related parts and structural elements. In such cases, it’s essential to carefully determine the sequence of events and accurately identify the primary fracture-causing component—otherwise, the analysis results could be misleading. 3) Identify the dominant crack on the primary failure component The dominant failure component may already be fragmented; therefore, the remaining fragments should be collected, carefully pieced together, and analyzed to identify which crack initiated first—this crack is the dominant one. 4) Identifying the Failure Source Area Once the dominant crack is identified, you can then examine the corresponding fracture surface to locate the crack initiation zone. 5) Fracture Surface Treatment If further microscopic analysis of the fracture surface is required, or if it’s necessary to preserve evidence, the fracture surface should be cleaned. Typically, clean with compressed air or alcohol, then dry thoroughly afterward. If long-term storage is required, apply rust-preventive oil or grease and store in a sealed container equipped with a desiccant. 6) Determine the cause of failure
Phenomenon After dismantling and cleaning the equipment components, it is impossible to restore them to their original mating precision. Cause Analysis The disassembly and cleaning work did not meet the required standards; additionally, the removed parts were poorly stored, resulting in moisture damage or physical injury—and in some cases, individual parts were even lost and replaced with substitutes. Hazardousness Hazardousness refers to the decline in mechanical equipment performance, potentially leading to complete failure and rendering the equipment unusable. Prevention and Control Measures"

4. Measures to Reduce Fracture Failure Fracture failure is one of the most dangerous forms of failure, and most metal parts fail due to various factors arising from metallurgy and part manufacturing processes. Because all of them contain cracks of varying sizes and characteristics, ranging from atomic-level dislocations to macroscopic cracks visible to the naked eye. However, a part with cracks doesn’t necessarily fail immediately—there’s typically a period during which these cracks undergo subcritical propagation. Moreover, under certain conditions, cracks may even remain stable without expanding at all. Therefore, by implementing effective measures, it’s possible to ensure that parts containing cracks do not ultimately fracture. Strategies to minimize fracture failures can be considered from the following perspectives. 1) Optimize the shape and structural design of parts, and carefully select appropriate materials for the components. Both geometric discontinuities in part shapes and material imperfections can lead to stress concentration. Geometric discontinuities are commonly referred to as notches, such as fillets at shoulders, grooves, oil holes, keyways, threads, and machining marks. Material-related discontinuities are typically called material defects, including shrinkage porosity, shrinkage cavities, non-metallic inclusions, and welding flaws. These areas prone to stress concentration are particularly susceptible to crack initiation and propagation under cyclic or impact loading, ultimately leading to fracture. Therefore, in part design, it’s crucial to minimize stress-concentration zones while carefully considering the part’s operating environment—such as the presence of corrosive media, temperature variations, and applied loads—and selecting appropriate materials accordingly. This approach helps effectively reduce the risk of fatigue failure. 2) Properly select the part machining method During various machining, welding, and heat treatment processes, residual stresses remain inside components due to factors such as plastic deformation, thermal expansion and contraction, and phase transformations occurring during these operations. Residual stresses are categorized into two types: residual tensile stress and residual compressive stress. While residual tensile stress is detrimental to component performance, residual compressive stress can significantly enhance the fatigue life of the part. Therefore, it is advisable to prioritize processes like carburizing, nitriding, shot peening, and surface rolling—methods known for generating beneficial compressive stresses—in component manufacturing. By inducing compressive stresses on the component’s surface, these techniques help counteract some of the tensile stresses caused by external loads, thereby improving the overall durability and longevity of the part. 3) Installation and Usage Instructions

1.3.4 Fracture of Mechanical Parts Fracture refers to the phenomenon where a mechanical component develops localized cracks or splits into several parts under the influence of certain factors. It is one of the primary modes of mechanical component failure—once a part fractures, it not only completely loses its functionality but can also lead to significant economic losses and even cause accidents resulting in injuries or fatalities. Particularly as modern manufacturing systems continue to evolve toward higher power levels and faster rotational speeds, the operating conditions for components have changed dramatically, increasing the likelihood of fracture-related failures. As a result, fracture failure has become a hot topic of research today. The fracture surface formed after a part breaks can accurately capture the dynamic evolution of the failure process. By analyzing the fracture surface, it is possible to identify the primary cause of the fracture, providing valuable insights that help refine designs and enable effective repairs. Based on the cause of failure, fractures can be categorized into types such as brittle fracture and fatigue fracture. Brittle Fracture Before fracturing, the component exhibits no noticeable plastic deformation; this type of fracture, which develops extremely rapidly, is known as brittle fracture.  Brittle fracture occurs without any prior warning signs, making it a sudden and highly dangerous form of failure. Metal parts may become brittle—and thus prone to sudden fracture— due to improper manufacturing processes, exposure to corrosive media during use, or adverse environmental conditions. For instance, the penetration of hydrogen or hydrides into met al materials can lead to  ""hydrogen embrittlement, "" while chloride ions infiltrating austenitic stainless steel may cause  ""chloride stress corrosion cracking. "" Similarly, nitrate ions entering carbon steel can trigger  ""nitrate embrittlement, "" and steel in contact with alkaline substances might suffer from  ""alkali embrittlement. "" Additionally, copper components exposed to ammonia can experience  ""ammonia-induced embrittlement. "" Furthermore, at ambient temperatures between 10°C and 15°C, medium- to low-strength carbon steels are particularly susceptible to  ""cold embrittlement "" (often caused by elevated phosphorus content in the steel). Meanwhile, aluminum-containing alloys, if not carefully temperature-controlled during heat treatment, can easily overh eat—even with only a slight deviation from the optimal range—leading to severe embrittlement. The hazards posed by brittle fracture in metals are significant, second only to those  associated with fatigue failure. Fatigue Fracture The fracture phenomenon that occurs in metal parts after being subjected to a certain number of cyclic loads or alternating stresses is known as fatigue failure. In fact, 80% of fractures in mechanical components during use are caused by fatigue. Typically, fatigue failure progresses through three distinct stages: the initiation phase of fatigue cracks; the propagation phase of fatigue cracks; and finally, catastrophic failure—the unstable, rapid growth phase of the fatigue crack. Below, we will analyze the fracture surfaces associated with fatigue failure. A typical fatigue fracture typically exhibits 3 distinct features based on the fracture process. Regions with distinct characteristics: fatigue core zone, fatigue crack propagation Zone and transient zone, as shown in Figure 1.4. Fatigue Core Zone It is the source region of fatigue fracture, visible to the naked eye or under low magnification. A magnifying glass can pinpoint the location of the fatigue core on the fracture surface—it typically does. Appearing in the area with the lowest intensity, highest stress, and closest to the surface Position. But if there are defects inside the material, this fatigue core... It could also occur at the defect site. Scratches left behind during the machining, storage, transportation, and assembly processes are highly likely to become fatigue nuclei, as these marks not only cause stress concentrations but also remain vulnerable to corrosion damage from air and other environmental factors."

2) Condition Monitoring and Maintenance This is a preventive maintenance approach based on the equipment's technical condition, carried out precisely when needed. It relies on condition monitoring and advanced diagnostic techniques to track the gradual deterioration of equipment over time. By leveraging highly predictive insights, this method allows for timely scheduling of preventive maintenance activities, which is why it’s also referred to as ""predictive maintenance."" At its core, this maintenance strategy integrates comprehensive data from various sources—such as inspections, routine upkeep, operational use, and repair activities—especially insights gained from diagnostics and monitoring. Through rigorous statistical analysis, it accurately assesses the extent of equipment degradation, identifies specific areas where failures may occur (or are likely to occur), and predicts trends in the equipment’s overall technical condition. Armed with this information, operators can then determine the most appropriate type of maintenance intervention. By doing so, organizations gain full control over maintenance activities, ensuring thorough preparation before repairs begin. Moreover, this approach enables seamless coordination with production schedules, maximizing equipment utilization while simultaneously extending the lifespan of critical components. However, this method does come with some drawbacks: it tends to be more expensive and requires sophisticated diagnostic capabilities. Additionally, it demands highly skilled technicians who can interpret complex data and make informed decisions. This approach is particularly well-suited for critical, high-value equipment, key assets on production lines, machinery that cannot be easily disassembled for inspection (such as precision machine tools), and systems whose failure could lead to significant environmental or public health concerns.
5. Improve Maintenance Improvement maintenance, also known as corrective maintenance, refers to a type of repair that enhances the technical performance of mechanical and electrical equipment to prevent recurring failures. It involves integrating maintenance activities with technological upgrades, ensuring that after repairs, key aspects such as precision, performance, and efficiency of the equipment are improved. Rate. During operation, mechanical and electrical equipment often has certain weak links, which necessitates technical improvements and structural modifications to specific devices or components. These enhancements aim to boost reliability and elevate the overall technological level of the equipment, ultimately leading to better economic outcomes. A key feature of improvement-based maintenance is its integrated approach, frequently combined with major overhauls and targeted repairs in actual production settings. When implementing such improvement maintenance, it’s essential to systematically address and refine the mechanisms of the equipment, as well as enhance the diagnostic and repair capabilities of electromechanical systems—based on thorough inspection and analysis of component failures. 10"

Cultivate a culture and habit of consciously caring for equipment,  ensuring it remains regularly clean, safe, and in optimal technical condition. 1.2.5 Maintenance and保养 of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment 1) Principles of Operation and Maintenance Procedures Mechanical and electrical equipment maintenance refers to the tasks performed to eliminate inevitable abnormal technical conditions that arise during operation (such as loose parts , dry friction, or unusual noises). Overall, maintaining mechanical and electrical equipment requires meeting four fundamental criteria: neatness, cleanliness, lubrication, and saf ety. Developing clear equipment operation and maintenance procedures is a crucial step in ensuring that all subsequent operations are carried out systematically and efficiently. Th e principles for creating these operational and maintenance guidelines are outlined below. (1) General guidelines should list precautions according to the equipment operation seque nce, as well as before, during, and after shifts—aiming for concise, clear, and practical content. (2) List the structural features, processing range, operational precautions, main tenance requirements, and more separately by equipment category, making it easier for operators to grasp the key points and ensure proper implementation. (3) Common elements across  various types of mechanical and electrical equipment can be used to develop a unified, standard general procedure. (4) Key equipment, high-precision, large and medium-sized, as we ll as rare and critical electromechanical devices, must have operation and maintenance procedures prepared separately. Also, post prominent signage near the machine tool, clearly i ndicating that operators should pay special attention and strictly adhere to the guidelines. 2) Basic Content of Operation and Maintenance Procedures
4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃ 3Fe + 2O₂ → Fe₃O₄ Corrosion products such as Fe₂O₃ or Fe₃O₄ typically form a protective film that coats the metal surface. During friction, Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment 21 After the surface oxide film is worn away, the friction surface quickly reacts with the oxidizing medium, forming a new oxide layer that is subsequently removed during the friction  process. This cyclical process ultimately leads to metal corrosion. A key characteristic of oxidative wear is the presence of uniform, fine grooves aligned along the sliding direc tion on the friction surface, accompanied by reddish-brown flaky Fe₂O₃ or grayish-black filamentous Fe₃O₄ debris. Debris is generated. The primary factors influencing oxidative wea r are the density and integrity of the oxide film, as well as how firmly it adheres to the substrate. If the oxide film is dense, intact, free of pores, and strongly bonded to the  metal substrate, it exhibits excellent wear resistance, resists being worn away easily, and effectively helps prevent corrosion of the metal surface. 2. Electrochemical Corrosion o f Metal Parts Electrochemical corrosion is a complex physical and chemical process of corrosion. It can be defined as the continuous, charge-driven chemical corrosion that occurs w hen two metal electrodes with a potential difference are immersed in an electrolyte solution. This type of corrosion happens when metals come into contact with electrolytic substan ces, and its key distinction from ordinary chemical corrosion lies in the fact that it involves the flow of electric current during the process. The fundamental conditions necessar y for electrochemical corrosion to occur are: ① the presence of two or more objects with differing electrode potentials—or, within a single object, regions exhibiting different ele ctrode potentials—that act as positive and negative electrodes; ② a conductive pathway connecting the electrodes, either through a conductor or direct contact, allowing charges in  the corrosion zone to flow freely; and ③ the simultaneous presence of an electrolyte solution. Common forms of electrochemical corrosion include the following: (1) Uniform corrosio n. When a metal part or component exhibits a uniform corrosion pattern across its surface, it is referred to as uniform corrosion. This type of corrosion can occur in liquids, the  atmosphere, or soil. Among mechanical equipment, the most common form of uniform corrosion is atmospheric corrosion. In industrial areas, the atmosphere often contains higher conce ntrations of corrosive gases such as CO₂, SO₂, H₂S, NO₂, and Cl₂. Additionally, airborne dust particles may carry acidic, alkaline, or saline micro-particles, which, when adhering  to the surface of components, can absorb moisture from the air and form an electrolyte, ultimately leading to corrosion on the part's surface. (2) Pitting corrosion. On most surfac es of metal components, corrosion either doesn’t occur at all or is very mild; however, localized areas develop small corrosion pits that penetrate deeply into the material. This t ype of corrosion is known as pitting corrosion. Because metals used in industry often contain extremely tiny microelectrodes, they are highly susceptible to pitting corrosion when  exposed to aqueous solutions or humid environments. In the case of steel components, when pitting corrosion occurs alongside uniform corrosion, the corrosion spots can easily becom e obscured by the porous structure formed during uniform corrosion, making them difficult to detect and identify. As a result, pitting corrosion is one of the most dangerous forms  of corrosion. (3) Crevice corrosion. In机电 equipment, gaps exist between various connected components—typically ranging from 0.025 to 0.1 mm. When corrosive media enter these gaps a nd remain trapped, localized corrosion can occur precisely at the crevices. For instance, this type of crevice corrosion often happens at flange faces where pipes are connected, as  well as at the riveted joints of metal rivets. (4) Corrosion Fatigue. When metallic components subjected to cyclic stress experience reduced fatigue strength or shortened fatigue  life—and ultimately fail—due to the presence of a corrosive environment, this phenomenon is known as corrosion fatigue or corrosion fatigue fracture. Corrosion fatigue can cause me tal components to fracture even under very low levels of cyclic (pulsating) stress, and often there is no clear fatigue limit. As a result, damage caused by corrosion fatigue tends  to be more severe than that resulting from pure mechanical fatigue alone. To prevent and reduce corrosion failures, as well as minimize their harmful effects on equipment, special  attention must be paid during the manufacturing process to correctly selecting materials for components and thoughtfully designing various structural elements. Additionally, for p arts operating in corrosive environments, advanced anti-corrosion measures such as surface coating technologies, electrochemical protection techniques, and the addition of corrosio n inhibitors should be employed to ensure that these components remain protected—or at least minimally affected—by corrosive agents.
When designing, it's essential to consider not only the strength of the parts but also their stiffness, as well as issues related to manufacturing, assembly, usage, disassembly, and maintenance. (1) Select materials carefully, paying attention to their process properties—such as casting fluidity and shrinkage, forging ductility and cold-heading capability, weldability characteristics like susceptibility to cold and hot cracking, machinability for ease of cutting, and heat-treatment properties including hardenability and resistance to cold brittleness. (2) Properly arrange the parts to optimize their stress distribution. Select appropriate structural dimensions, ensuring uniform wall thicknesses as much as possible, and minimize deformation during hot working processes. For instance, avoid sharp corners by replacing them with rounded or chamfered edges; for areas with significant thickness variations, consider adding process holes or reinforcing excessively thin sections. Additionally, carefully position any existing holes—transforming blind holes into through-holes where feasible. For parts with complex geometries, whenever possible, opt for modular or assembled designs to further enhance stress management. (3) In the design process, ensure the application of new technologies, processes, and materials to minimize internal stresses and deformation during manufacturing. 2) Manufacturing In the rough casting manufacturing process, it is important to address deformation issues and implement various process measures to minimize residual stresses in the blank. After the raw parts are produced and during subsequent machining processes, it is essential to incorporate sufficient steps for relieving internal stresses, aiming to minimize residual stresses within the components. One effective method to eliminate these residuals is through aging treatment, which can be either natural or artificial. Natural aging involves leaving the finished raw parts exposed outdoors for 1 to 2 years. This approach leverages the material’s inherent property of gradually releasing internal stresses over a period of 12 to 20 months—making it particularly effective—but the main drawback is the excessively long aging cycle. On the other hand, artificial aging accelerates the stress-relief process by subjecting the parts to high-temperature annealing followed by controlled cooling at a slow pace. Alternatively, vibrational techniques can also be employed to achieve artificial aging. For high-precision components, artificial aging must be integrated into the final machining stages to ensure optimal dimensional accuracy and stability. During machining and repair processes, minimize the number of datum shifts, preserving the original machining datums for use during maintenance, thereby reducing repair time. Errors caused by inconsistent benchmarks during machining. For parts that have undergone heat treatment, be sure to allow sufficient machining allowances and adjust the machining dimensions accordingly. Pre-applying controlled deformation is crucial—once the deformation patterns of the part are understood, you can counteract them in advance by introducing an equal but opposite amount of deformation. Alternatively, you can pre-stress the part or carefully manage the generation and evolution of stresses, ensuring that the final deformation aligns with specifications and effectively minimizes distortion. 3) Maintenance Aspects During maintenance, it is essential to not only meet the technical requirements—such as restoring part dimensions, ensuring proper fit tolerances, and achieving high surface quality—but also to inspect and correct any shape or positional errors in critical components. To minimize stress and deformation of parts during repair, standardized guidelines and maintenance procedures specifically addressing deformation issues should be established. Additionally, simple, reliable, and user-friendly specialized measuring tools and fixtures should be designed. Finally, it’s important to actively promote ""three new"" technologies, particularly innovative repair techniques like brush plating and bonding. 4) Usage Instructions

In practice, these tasks should be carried out according to the overhaul work plan, while also ensuring effective job scheduling, quality control during operations, and thorough completion acceptance. The major overhaul process for mechanical and electrical equipment is typically divided into three stages: pre-repair preparation, the repair process itself, and post-repair acceptance. Pre-repair preparation phase To ensure the repair work proceeds smoothly and accurately, maintenance personnel should carefully listen to operators' requirements for equipment repairs and thoroughly understand the issues affecting the equipment being serviced—such as loss of precision, the extent of wear on major mechanical components, the accuracy of the transmission system, and any visible defects.

1.4.1 Preparations Before Mechanical Equipment Maintenance Electromechanical equipment occupies a critically important position in the production and operational activities of modern industrial enterprises. To ensure smooth equipment operation and safe production, implementing planned preventive maintenance is an essential component of equipment management and repair practices in industrial companies. This section will cover the detailed process of major equipment overhauls, the determination of equipment repair plans, as well as the technical and material preparations required prior to equipment maintenance. 1. Equipment Major Overhaul Process To ensure the precision and operational performance of mechanical and electrical equipment, preventive scheduled maintenance must be carried out in addition to routine upkeep. Among these preventive measures, major overhauls stand out as a critical task aimed at restoring the equipment's accuracy. Within the category of preventive maintenance, major overhauls—often referred to simply as ""overhauls""—represent the most extensive and time-consuming type of repair. An overhaul involves completely or largely disassembling the equipment, repairing or replacing foundational components, refurbishing mechanical and electrical parts, recalibrating the electrical systems, and finally reassembling and fine-tuning the entire unit. The ultimate goal is to thoroughly eliminate any pre-existing defects and restore the equipment to its specified performance standards. The purpose of precision and performance. The major steps involved in the overhaul of mechanical and electrical equipment typically include: pre-disassembly unit inspection, component removal, component inspection, necessary component disassembly, parts cleaning and examination, component repair and assembly, final assembly, no-load trial operation, load testing, overall machine precision verification, and final acceptance. In practice, these tasks should be carried out according to the overhaul work plan, while also ensuring effective job scheduling, quality control during operations, and thorough completion acceptance. The major overhaul process for mechanical and electrical equipment is typically divided into three stages: pre-repair preparation, the repair process itself, and post-repair acceptance. Pre-repair preparation phase To ensure the repair work proceeds smoothly and accurately, maintenance personnel should carefully listen to operators' requirements for equipment repairs and thoroughly understand the issues affecting the equipment being serviced—such as loss of precision, the extent of wear on major mechanical components, the accuracy of the transmission system, and any visible defects. They should also identify which parts need improvement or modification to meet the equipment’s operational specifications. Additionally, they should review relevant technical documentation, equipment manuals, and previous maintenance records to become familiar with the device’s structural features, transmission system, and original design precision standards. This preparation will enable them to propose comprehensive pre-inspection tasks. Following the pre-inspection, specific repair methods for critical and large components can be determined, allowing for the preparation of specialized tools and precision measuring instruments. Finally, the team must define the post-repair precision testing procedures and establish clear acceptance criteria for trial runs, ensuring all technical preparations are fully in place before proceeding with the complete overhaul of the equipment.
28 Determine the form and compensation method for the error compensation环节, ensuring assembly accuracy among all components—such as parallelism, coaxiality, perpendicularity, and the required meshing precision of the transmission. 3) Post-Repair Acceptance Phase All equipment that has undergone repair, assembly, and adjustment must be subjected to comprehensive precision checks and tests—such as geometric accuracy inspections, no-load running tests, load tests, and working precision evaluations—in accordance with the relevant prescribed accuracy standards or the precision criteria established prior to repair. These measures ensure a thorough assessment of the repaired equipment’s quality, restored precision, and overall performance. After equipment maintenance, record the modifications made to the original technical documentation and document any lessons learned during the repair process. Prepare a thorough post-repair summary and file it alongside the original documents for future reference during the next maintenance task. 2. Determining the Equipment Maintenance Plan Major equipment overhauls must not only meet the predetermined technical requirements but also strive to enhance economic efficiency. Therefore, before starting repairs, it’s essential to thoroughly assess the equipment’s technical condition, develop a practical and feasible repair plan, and ensure comprehensive preparation—both technically and in terms of production readiness. During the repair process, actively incorporate new technologies, materials, processes, and modern management techniques, while diligently managing technical, financial, and organizational aspects to guarantee high-quality workmanship, minimize downtime, and reduce overall maintenance costs. A pre-inspection must be conducted to thoroughly assess the equipment's technical condition before repairs, identify the main defects present, and analyze the product-specific process requirements that influence the equipment's technical specifications—allowing for the immediate development of a repair plan. 3. Technical Preparation Before Equipment Maintenance Preparation for equipment maintenance involves two key aspects: technical preparation and production readiness. The technical preparation prior to maintenance is the responsibility of the lead technician, and its main tasks include pre-inspection planning and research, conducting the actual pre-inspection, and preparing comprehensive overhaul technical documentation. Meanwhile, production readiness before the overhaul is managed by personnel responsible for spare parts, materials, and tools, as well as the production planners from the maintenance unit. Their primary responsibilities encompass ordering, manufacturing, inspecting, and storing critical materials, spare parts, and specialized tools, gauges, and testing equipment—along with developing the overall maintenance production schedule. Pre-inspection survey preparation work To gain a comprehensive understanding of the specific condition of equipment degradation, schedule a shutdown inspection before the major overhaul—this is referred to as a pre-inspection. Before conducting the equipment pre-inspection, ensure the following preparatory investigations are completed. (1) Review the following equipment records: factory inspection reports; precision and performance verification records from equipment installation acceptance tests; details of all past equipment incidents, malfunctions, and repairs, including any remaining issues after repairs; records of all previous maintenance activities, including replaced or repaired components, as well as any unresolved problems left behind after servicing; and operational status monitoring logs and comprehensive equipment inspection records.
5. Improve Maintenance Improvement maintenance, also known as corrective maintenance, refers to a type of repair that enhances the technical performance of mechanical and electrical equipment to prevent recurring failures. It involves integrating maintenance activities with technological upgrades, ensuring that after repairs, key aspects such as precision, performance, and efficiency of the equipment are improved. Rate. During operation, mechanical and electrical equipment often has certain weak links, which necessitates technical improvements and structural modifications to specific devices or components. These enhancements aim to boost reliability and elevate the overall technological level of the equipment, ultimately leading to better economic outcomes. A key feature of improvement-based maintenance is its integrated approach, frequently combined with major overhauls and targeted repairs in actual production settings. When implementing such improvement maintenance, it’s essential to systematically address and refine the mechanisms of the equipment, as well as enhance the diagnostic and repair capabilities of electromechanical systems—based on thorough inspection and analysis of component failures. 10
③ Having well-equipped maintenance facilities organized according to functional divisions and strategically located for optimal efficiency. The main drawback of the planned preven tive maintenance system is its poor cost-effectiveness. With fixed maintenance cycles and scopes, it often leads to unnecessary repairs of certain components—what’s known as over-m aintenance. During the maintenance process, repairs are categorized into several levels and types based on the depth and breadth of the work required, including major overhauls, mi d-level repairs, minor repairs, item-specific repairs, retrofits, and unplanned maintenance tasks—all determined by the scale and nature of the repair workload. (1) Overhaul: A com prehensive or fundamental restoration of the functionality of mechanical and electrical equipment, typically carried out by specialized maintenance teams within factories and mines —or at repair centers established in regions with a high concentration of industrial facilities. During an overhaul, the equipment is either fully or extensively disassembled, with  a focus on repairing critical components, replacing or refurbishing parts that have lost their function or are on the verge of doing so. After the repairs, the equipment’s precisi on is restored to nearly its original factory specifications, while also receiving a fresh cosmetic overhaul to enhance its appearance. (2) Intermediate Overhaul. This is a level o f maintenance that falls between major and minor overhauls, serving as a balanced approach to upkeep. (3) Minor Repair. This involves replacing or repairing components that have si gnificantly worn out or are nearing failure within the maintenance interval, without addressing any underlying structural issues. It is a troubleshooting-based repair aimed at rest oring functionality. The three levels—major overhaul, mid-term repair, and minor repair—objectively reflect the chronological progression of机电 equipment, making them ideally suited  for implementing time-based planned preventive maintenance, a practice widely adopted by most organizations. However, these levels still require complementary repair tiers to addr ess unforeseen maintenance needs effectively. (4) Item-based maintenance. Based on condition monitoring of mechanical and electrical equipment, this involves proactively planning r epairs specifically for components or technical items that are about to fail. Item-based maintenance is conducted between major, medium, and minor overhauls—it’s a non-periodic, pl anned maintenance level that doesn’t follow a fixed cycle. (5) Retrofitting. This involves making localized modifications to existing mechanical and electrical equipment using new  technologies, materials, structures, and processes, with the goal of enhancing its precision, functionality, productivity, and reliability. Such repairs are classified as improveme nt-oriented, and the extent of the work required depends on how well the original equipment’s design accommodates the retrofitting process—as well as on the specific level of perfo rmance enhancement desired for the equipment. Retrofitting is also referred to as modernization or upgrading. (6) Unscheduled Maintenance. This is a level of maintenance required f or mechanical and electrical equipment due to sudden breakdowns and accidents. The fewer the number and scope of unscheduled maintenance activities, the higher the level of managem ent.
2) Maintenance Process Stage Once the maintenance process begins, the first step is to disassemble the equipment—following a sequence and approach that reverses the original assembly order, adhering to the principle of ""top-down and outside-in."" This systematic method carefully releases the components from their interlocking and fixed positions within the machine. After removal, each part should undergo a secondary pre-inspection. Based on the findings from this second check, any additional repair parts required will be identified. Furthermore, the availability of replacement and repaired components, along with their current status, will help establish a rough schedule for the maintenance tasks. This ensures that the repair work progresses methodically and according to plan, preventing delays caused by poor coordination in organizational efforts. The precision and performance achievable during equipment maintenance depend on factors such as the technical expertise available for repair work, the number of major overhauls the equipment has undergone, and its pre-repair technical condition.

Conversely, if the previous overhaul left the equipment in suboptimal condition, it may create significant challenges for the next major repair—and in some cases, the resulting quality might even fail to meet the original factory standards, making further repairs impractical altogether. The assembly of the complete equipment is carried out according to acceptance criteria. During assembly, appropriate reference surfaces should be selected for accurate mechanical and electrical system fault diagnosis and maintenance case studies."

(3) Completion and Acceptance. After the major equipment overhaul is completed and successfully tested by the maintenance unit, the equipment undergoes a formal completion and acceptance process. The acceptance is led by a representative from the equipment management department, who, along with representatives from quality control and the user department, verifies that all repair tasks specified in the repair work order have been fully accomplished and that the equipment meets both quality standards and technical requirements. Once this is confirmed, all parties involved sign the ""Equipment Repair Completion Report"" to officially approve the work.

2) Basis for preparing the maintenance plan, as well as considerations and key steps to be addressed.
④ Equipment maintenance cycles and maintenance intervals. (2) The following issues should be considered when preparing the maintenance plan. ① Equipment critical to production needs, impacting product quality, and essential to key processes should be prioritized. ② Single critical equipment on the production line should, whenever possible, be scheduled for maintenance during holidays to minimize downtime. ③ Equipment for continuous or periodic production (thermal and power equipment) must be properly scheduled according to their specific characteristics, ensuring that equipment maintenance is closely integrated with production tasks. ④ Special requirements for precision equipment maintenance. ⑤ The balance of maintenance workload should be considered to ensure that repair activities are evenly distributed throughout the year. Prioritize and schedule maintenance tasks for equipment based on their urgency and importance. ⑥ The workload and timeline for pre-repair production technology preparation should be taken into account. ⑦ Arrange similar equipment continuously whenever possible. ⑧ Comprehensively consider the availability of technology, materials, labor, and funding sources required for equipment maintenance. (3) Preparation of the Annual Maintenance Plan. The five steps involved in compiling the annual maintenance plan are outlined below. ① Thoroughly assess the actual technical condition of the equipment requiring maintenance, and analyze the ease or difficulty of performing repairs.
⑤ Propose solutions to address the contradictions that have emerged in the above 4 steps. (4) Typically, the equipment maintenance plan for the following year is prepared in September each year. The preparation process follows these 4 steps: ① Gather information. Before drafting the plan, thorough data collection and analysis must be conducted. This primarily involves two key areas: first, technical condition data of the equipment, such as original documentation, equipment inspection forms, product process requirements, and quality-related information, to determine the appropriate maintenance category; and second, the annual production schedule, equipment maintenance quotas, relevant technical specifications for the equipment, and current inventory levels of spare parts. ② Prepare the draft. When drafting, fully consider how the annual production plan impacts equipment requirements, ensuring that maintenance schedules are aligned with production plans. This will help prevent both under-maintenance and over-maintenance of equipment. Before formally submitting the draft annual maintenance plan, the equipment management department, under the leadership of the chief plant manager, should organize a comprehensive technical and economic analysis and evaluation involving departments such as process engineering, technology, operations, and production—aiming to achieve well-balanced, rational objectives. ③ Balanced Approval. After the draft plan is completed, it is distributed to the production, planning, engineering, technical, finance, and user departments for discussion. Participants are invited to propose modifications, such as adding or removing items, adjusting maintenance downtime durations, setting machine-off delivery dates, and revising maintenance categories. Once these inputs are comprehensively evaluated and balanced, the final maintenance plan is formally prepared and submitted to senior management for approval. The maintenance plan must be filled out on the prescribed form, including details such as: the equipment’s basic information (user department, asset number, name, and model), the repair complexity factor, the type or scope of the repair work, time quotas, downtime duration, planned schedule, and the responsible maintenance contractor. Additionally, a plan description should be prepared, highlighting key priorities, identifying potential weak links, and outlining critical issues that need attention. Finally, preliminary measures and recommendations should be proposed to address these crucial challenges effectively. ④ Issue for execution. Before December each year, the enterprise's production planning department will issue the equipment maintenance plan for the following year, serving as the basis for the company's operations.

Before turning on the equipment, inspect each operating handle and control device according to the items specified in the daily inspection checklist to ensure they are in the off position. Check whether any components show signs of severe wear, damage requiring replacement, or loose connections posing safety risks. Verify that all safety protection devices are intact and securely fastened. Also, confirm that the power supply is functioning properly and keep a detailed inspection record. If any issues are found that fail to meet safety standards, promptly submit safety improvement suggestions or solutions to the workshop supervisor to prevent the equipment from operating while faulty. (3) Check whether the wires and control cabinets are damaged, whether the surrounding environment is reliable, and whether the equipment's grounding or earthing facilities are safe. If any issues are detected, take protective measures immediately. (4) Check the oil quality and level in lubrication and hydraulic systems; replenish oil according to the lubrication chart, ensuring the oil remains clean, the oil lines are unobstructed, and lubrication is optimal. Proper lubrication not only guarantees effective cooling and heat dissipation but also provides sealing and protective functions. Additionally, it plays a significant role in cleaning away contaminants and reducing wear. (5) After confirming that all components are functioning correctly, you may first run the machine at low speed for 3–5 minutes with no load. Ensure that all parts operate smoothly and are well-lubricated before proceeding with actual work. Never exceed the recommended load or use the equipment outside of specified guidelines. (6) While the equipment is running, it is strictly prohibited to adjust the workpiece by hand or to perform lubrication, remove debris, or wipe down the machine. When leaving the machine tool, always turn off the power supply. During operation, closely monitor the condition of all components; if any abnormalities are detected, immediately stop the machine and address the issue. (7) When maintaining, servicing, or cleaning equipment and instruments, ensure that the equipment and instruments are powered down and the power supply is completely turned off. Additionally, clearly display or hang warning signs at the work site to indicate that the equipment is undergoing maintenance or repair, or that personnel are present for ongoing work. (8) Before maintenance and servicing, personnel should be aware of the precautions specific to this task and follow the proper maintenance procedures. During maintenance, staff must remain fully focused, wear appropriate safety gear, and ensure their standing position is secure. (9) When maintaining equipment, use disassembly tools correctly; unauthorized assembly or disassembly is strictly prohibited. Do not remove or alter the equipment's Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance at will. 15 Safety protection device: When positioning or assembling the equipment, never insert your hands into the mating surfaces or use your fingers to align holes. (10) After completing maintenance, repair, and other operational tasks, equipment should be removed from the work area, and the workspace along with machinery must be thoroughly cleaned. Every component of the equipment’s instruments and gauges should be carefully inspected, ensuring that no tools or other items are left behind—either on the equipment or inside it. Additionally, the workshop should conduct regular maintenance, upkeep, and repairs to ensure the smooth operation of all machinery. (11) Instructions, safety signs, and signage located within the workshop and on machinery must be strictly followed at all times. (12) It is strictly prohibited to use flammable or volatile substances for wiping equipment. Oil-soaked rags must not be left on the equipment, and no flammable or explosive materials are allowed to be stored near the equipment. (13) When working in flammable and explosive hazard areas, appropriate safety measures must be taken beforehand and approved by the production safety department and management before proceeding. Additionally, when welding or grinding containers or pipelines containing flammable, explosive, or toxic materials, these must first be properly purged and thoroughly cleaned—and all openings must be fully opened—before work can begin. (14) The work area should be dry and clean. Used oil and waste rags must not be discarded randomly on the floor. Raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished goods must be neatly stacked, and blocking passageways is strictly prohibited. (15) Regularly maintain the cleanliness of lubrication and hydraulic systems. Keep the tank lid securely closed, ensuring no water, dust, metal chips, or other contaminants enter the oil tank or electrical equipment. (16) After finishing work and before leaving for the day, clean the machine tools and equipment thoroughly, ensuring they remain tidy. Return operating handles, buttons, and other controls to their non-working positions, turn off the power supply, and complete the handover procedures with the next shift. 3) Classification of Maintenance and Servicing Tasks Depending on the depth, scope, and volume of work involved in equipment maintenance and upkeep, maintenance tasks can be categorized into the following types. (1) Daily Maintenance (Routine Maintenance). Its main tasks include: inspecting and lubricating the equipment; strictly following the equipment operation procedures. Cheng uses the equipment to tighten any loose parts; cleans and wipes down the equipment, checks its operational status, and records the condition in the shift handover log. This type of maintenance is relatively simple, with most tasks performed on the equipment's surface. Daily maintenance should be carried out by the operating personnel. (2) First-Level Maintenance (Monthly Maintenance). The main tasks include: disassembling specified components such as the housing cover and protective shields, thoroughly cleaning and wiping both the inside and outside of the equipment; inspecting and adjusting clearance gaps between parts, tightening any loose components, and replacing individual wear-and-tear parts; clearing oil passages, cleaning filters, and replacing coolant while also flushing the coolant tank; cleaning guideways and sliding surfaces, removing burrs and scratches; and inspecting and adjusting electrical wiring and related devices. This first-level maintenance is performed after the equipment has been running for 1 to 2 months (under a two-shift system), primarily by operational staff with support from maintenance technicians. (3) Second-Level Maintenance (Annual Maintenance). In addition to the tasks included in first-level maintenance, second-level maintenance also involves repairing or replacing worn parts, adjusting clearances in components such as guides, maintaining the electrical system, and inspecting and fine-tuning equipment accuracy. This type of maintenance is carried out once a year after the equipment has been in operation, primarily by maintenance technicians with the participation of operators. 1.2.6 Equipment Fault Diagnosis Technology When equipment malfunctions, certain characteristics change accordingly, leading to variations in mechanical, thermal, acoustic, and electromagnetic physical and chemical parameters—each carrying distinct types of information. By capturing these altered indicators, detecting the underlying signals and patterns, and analyzing their causes and anomalies, fault diagnosis technology enables us to pinpoint the location, nature, and severity of the failure, as well as forecast future issues, assess damage conditions, make informed decisions, eliminate potential hazards, and ultimately prevent accidents from occurring. This is precisely what fault diagnosis technology aims to achieve. Mechatronic System Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance Case Studies Tutorial
(2) Read the equipment manual and equipment catalog. (3) Survey equipment operators and maintenance personnel: Identify parts of the equipment that are prone to failures during operation and the underlying causes; assess the equipment’s precision and overall performance; highlight the major existing defects; and gather specific recommendations for repairs and improvements required during major overhauls. (4) Solicit input from departments such as Technology, Quality, and Production Management regarding localized equipment improvements. Pre-screening (1) The purpose of the pre-inspection. Through pre-inspection, we can comprehensively and thoroughly assess the deterioration of equipment conditions, gain a clearer understanding of how product processes affect the equipment’s precision and performance, thereby identifying which parts need to be replaced or repaired. This information then allows us to create detailed drawings or verify existing ones for these parts, ensuring they meet the requirements for manufacturing and repair work. (2) Pre-inspection content: Typically, the pre-inspection content is determined based on the equipment type and the pre-repair investigation. (3) Inspect geometric and operational accuracy item by item, according to the equipment manufacturer's precision standards and inspection methods for each country or enterprise. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance
32 (3) Critical mating surfaces must fit tightly together. After tightening, use a 0.04 mm feeler gauge to check—no insertion should be possible. For particularly critical mating surfaces, in addition to the color-checking method, a 0.04 mm feeler gauge must also be used both before and after tightening; no insertion is allowed. (4) For sliding joint surfaces, in addition to using the color-checking method, a 0.04 mm feeler gauge must also be used for inspection. The insertion depth shall comply with the following specifications: when the machine tool weighs no more than 10 tons, the insertion depth should be less than 20 mm; when the machine tool weighs over 10 tons, the insertion depth should be less than 25 mm. (5) For machine tools equipped with hydrostatic devices, the ""throttling ratio"" must meet the design specifications. Once hydrostatic pressure is established, movement should be smooth and effortless. Convenient and flexible. When the hydrostatic guide is unloaded, the difference in lift height around the moving components must not exceed the design specifications. (6) Adjustable bearings and shims should be installed with sufficient adjustment clearance. (7) Handwheels and handles equipped with indexing mechanisms must have a backlash no greater than the following specifications: for high-precision machine tools, no more than 1/40 r; for general-purpose and precision machine tools weighing up to 10 tons, no more than 1/20 r; and for general-purpose and precision machine tools exceeding 10 tons, no specific limit is provided. More than 1/4 r. (8) The operating force for handwheels and handles should be uniform throughout the travel range and must not exceed the limits specified in Table 1.3. Table 1.3: Operating Forces for Handwheels and Handles
(1) Different-colored wires should be used for different circuits; if the same color wire is employed, it must have insulating tubes of different colors fitted at both ends. (2) In the machine tool's control circuit, both ends of the wires should be fitted with numerical markers that match the wiring positions indicated on the terminal block. These marker numbers must be resistant to peeling off and staining. (3) For machine tool electrical components, ensure their safety and reliability; they must not be damaged by cutting fluids, lubricants, or chips. (4) The insulation resistance at all grounded points of the machine tool's electrical components must not be less than 1 MΩ when measured with a 500 V megohmmeter; additionally, the insulation resistance of motor windings (excluding wiring) must be at least 0.5 MΩ. (5) Motors operated by magnetic contactors must be equipped with undervoltage protection. This ensures that the circuit is disconnected in the event of a sudden power failure or a drop in supply voltage, and prevents automatic restart when power is restored. (6) To protect the machine tool's motor and electrical equipment from short circuits, it is essential to install a fusible fuse or a similar fast-acting protective device that meets technical specifications, as well as comply with safety requirements for electrical installations. (7) The machine tool lighting circuit should use a power supply with a voltage no higher than 36V. (8) The machine tool base, as well as the electrical box and cabinet bodies, should be equipped with dedicated grounding screws and grounding wires. (9) The door covers of electrical boxes and cabinets should be equipped with latches. 6) The aesthetic quality of the machine tool (1) The external surfaces of machine tools that are not being machined should be sprayed with light gray paint, or painted in any other color as specified. (2) The inner walls of the electrical box, oil tank, spindle box, gearbox, and other enclosures should all be painted white or another light color. (3) The painting process must meet standards, with no peeling, flaking, wrinkling, or loss of surface gloss allowed. (4) All machine tool signs should be complete, clearly visible, and securely mounted in the correct position. (5) The surfaces of handwheels and handles should be smooth and shiny, with no signs of rust. (6) All machine tool guards and hole covers, among other components, must remain intact. (7) The unfinished surfaces of the machine tool’s auxiliary electrical components and attachments should all match the surface paint color of the machine tool itself.
Rolling bearing: 70°C vs. 40°C (3) The machine tool's feed mechanism should undergo no-load tests at low, medium, and high feed speeds, while the rapid traverse mechanism should be tested under no-load conditions at its maximum rapid-speed setting. (4) During the machine tool's operational test, all mechanisms undergo startup, stopping, braking, automatic motion, gear-shift transitions, and rapid movements. All should be flexible and reliable. (5) All hydraulic, lubrication, and cooling systems must be free of leaks. (6) The pneumatic system and piping must not have any air leaks. (7) The machine tool's safety guards and protective devices must be complete, secure, and function reliably and sensitively. (8) The machine tool's accuracy must be checked both before and after the load test. For machine tools that do not undergo a load test, accuracy verification should be performed after the no-load running test. 2. Precision Inspection of Mechanical Equipment Maintenance After major overhauls of mechanical equipment, acceptance checks are conducted according to established standards, with each type of equipment having its own specific acceptance criteria and inspection methods. Take metal cutting machine tools as an example: the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has established various precision testing standards for different types of machine tools, along with general guidelines for machine tool accuracy verification. Similarly, China has developed its own standards that are either equivalent to or closely aligned with international benchmarks. These standards specify the inspection items, criteria, methods, and tolerances for machine tool accuracy—serving as the fundamental basis for conducting precision tests. Currently, machine tool maintenance is carried out based on both geometric and operational precision standards during acceptance procedures. Inspection of Machine Tool Geometric Accuracy Geometric accuracy of machine tools refers to the precision of the components that ultimately affect the machine's operational accuracy. It encompasses individual accuracies of basic structural elements, positional accuracy between various parts, as well as motion accuracy, positioning accuracy, indexing accuracy, and transmission chain accuracy. Typically, geometric accuracy checks are performed while the machine tool is stationary. Before conducting these inspections, it’s essential to first ensure proper installation and leveling. Follow the machine tool’s instruction manual carefully to install the equipment on a suitable foundation and achieve precise leveling. The primary goal of leveling is to guarantee the machine’s static stability, which facilitates accurate measurements during testing—especially those related to the straightness of machine components. Additionally, national standards have standardized methods for inspecting both geometric and operational accuracy of machine tools, providing a reliable reference for conducting geometric accuracy tests. Machine Tool Testing Since the geometric accuracy of machine tools is checked under static conditions, it cannot fully reflect the quality of machine tool maintenance. To determine whether a machine tool can maintain its original geometric accuracy under operational conditions and load applications, it must be evaluated through various machine tool tests. The key components of machine tool maintenance testing include no-load running tests, load tests, and working precision tests. (1) No-load operation test of the machine tool. The purpose of the no-load operation test is to further verify the correct functioning of each component of the machine tool. Sex, reliability, ease and normality of operation, as well as whether the temperature rise and noise levels of each moving component are within acceptable limits. The primary focus of the machine tool's no-load running test is to simultaneously check the operational status of relevant parts while testing the spindle and feed speeds. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance 35 Before conducting the no-load operation test of the machine tool, ensure that all major overhaul tasks have been completed and that each repair has met the required quality standards. Next, fill all oil reservoirs with lubricant and properly grease all lubrication points. It is crucial to note: Only after completing all necessary preparations in accordance with the safety operating procedures can you proceed with the no-load tests as outlined by the precision inspection standards specific to the machine tool being used. (2) Machine Tool Load Testing. The machine tool load test evaluates whether the machine’s main motion system can achieve the maximum torque and power allowed by the design, as well as checks if all machine components are functioning properly under these conditions, whether there are any positional changes between parts, and if such changes remain within the permissible limits. Additionally, it ensures that vibrations, noise levels, and temperature rise remain within normal operating ranges. The machine tool load test primarily involves performing a cutting-load test, where tools and cutting parameters are selected according to specified requirements to machine the surface of test specimens made from a particular material and in a specific size. During the load test, the spindle speed and feed rate are allowed to deviate by no more than 5% compared to the theoretical values. (3) Machine Tool Working Accuracy Test. The purpose of the machine tool working accuracy test is to determine whether the positional accuracy between the machine’s various components during the machining process meets the precision requirements of the parts being manufactured. Before the test, its geometric accuracy must be rechecked. The machine tool working accuracy test involves machining the surface of a specified test piece using cutting tools and appropriate cutting parameters, as outlined in the machine tool accuracy testing standards for working precision requirements. The geometric accuracy of the machined workpiece surface must fall within the tolerance range specified by the precision standards of the machine tool used, and the surface roughness value should not"

Context:  
Management of Maintenance Technical Documentation Equipment maintenance technical documentation primarily comes from the technical materials provided as part of the equipment purchase; materials acquired during use from equipment manufacturers, relevant organizations, scientific bookstores, and more; as well as documents designed, surveyed, and compiled in-house. Management is as described below. (1) Specification standards, including relevant international standards, national standards, departmentally issued standards, as well as applicable laws and regulations. (2) Drawing materials, including instruction manuals for mechanical power equipment within the company, partial equipment manufacturing drawings, maintenance and assembly diagrams, spare parts catalogues, and related technical documentation. (3) Layout Diagram of Power Station Equipment and Power Pipeline Network Diagram. (4) Process documentation, including maintenance procedures, parts repair processes, critical component manufacturing techniques, and drawings for specialized tools and fixtures, etc. (5) Maintenance Quality Standards and Equipment Testing Procedures. (6) General technical files, including equipment manuals, research reports, experimental data, calculation notes, cost analyses, claim reports, standard technical materials, patent documents, and relevant literature, among others. (7) Samples and books, including domestic and international samples, books, periodicals, electronic publications, CDs, floppy disks, photographs, and slides, among others. 2) Management Program Maintenance technical documentation is primarily intended for use within the equipment management system and should generally be managed centrally in a dedicated documentation room. The management process should encompass the entire lifecycle of the materials—covering collection, organization, evaluation, classification, numbering, reproduction (such as drafting), storage, retrieval, and distribution. Effective management of technical documentation requires prioritization: key equipment manuals, along with relevant assembly drawings, electrical schematics, and other critical documents, should be clearly marked for enhanced oversight. Importantly, these priority documents are typically not available for external loan. To facilitate compilation and retrieval, it is necessary to establish a coded indexing system for the data and implement computer-based management. The equipment maintenance manual serves as a comprehensive collection of specialized technical documentation for equipment repair, providing maintenance personnel with essential resources for troubleshooting, diagnosing faults, developing repair strategies, and even manufacturing spare parts when needed. The equipment maintenance manuals are compiled separately for each equipment model, and the manuals should include the following content. (1) Features and Feature Diagrams. The features and feature diagrams include an outline diagram, lifting diagram, installation foundation drawing, and Chapter 1—Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance. 51
② Inspection, maintenance, and assembly procedures for key components, as well as the technical specifications to be achieved. ③ The overall assembly procedure and the precision requirements, technical specifications, and inspection/measurement methods that the assembly process must meet. ④ Adjustment processes for critical components  and the corresponding technical specifications to be achieved. ⑤ Test run procedures, specifications, and technical requirements to be achieved after final assembly. ⑥ Detailed list of general or specialized tools, inspection and testing equipment, research fixtures, and measuring instruments required during major equipment overhauls, with specific notes indicating items that are custom-made. ⑦ Safety measures during major overhaul operations, etc. (3) Major Maintenance Quality Standards. When accepting the repair of mechanical equipment, reference can be made to general technical specifications for major equipment repairs established and issued by national and ministerial authorities, such as the General Technical Specifications for Major Repairs of Metal Cutting Machine Tools and the General Technical Specifications for Major Repairs of Forging and Pressing Equipment. Industries and enterprises may also develop their own specialized quality standards for major equipment repairs based on these relevant general technical guidelines. A Practical Guide to Fault Diagnosis and Repair Cases in Mechatronic Systems 30
6) Use correctly Under normal operating conditions, mechanical equipment follows its own failure patterns; however, when operating conditions change, these failure patterns also shift accordingly. The primary operating conditions include the following: (1) Load. The primary causes of wear and fatigue failure in mechanical equipment are the wear of components and their fatigue-induced damage. Under specified operating conditions, the rate of component wear over a given period is directly proportional to the magnitude of the load applied. Meanwhile, fatigue damage to components occurs only under certain types of cyclic loading and intensifies as the load increases. Thus, both wear and fatigue are functions of the applied load. Exceeding the design-rated load levels can lead to severe failure, which is unacceptable. (2) Environment. The environment includes the effects of climate, corrosive media, and other harmful substances, as well as the condition of the working object itself. Increased temperatures accelerate wear and corrosion, while excessively high humidity and corrosive agents present in the air can lead to both corrosion and corrosive wear. Additionally, excessive dust levels in the air and harsh operating conditions often contribute to equipment failures. However, the environment is an objective factor, and in certain situations, measures can be taken manually to improve it. (3) Maintenance and Operation. Establishing a sound maintenance system and strictly adhering to technical maintenance guidelines and operational procedures are crucial for ensuring the reliable performance of mechanical equipment and extending its service life. Additionally, it is essential to provide training for personnel to enhance their skills and expertise.
The degree is very high. Choose a reasonable running-in load, relative motion speed, and lubrication. Slip conditions and other parameters are key to shortening the break-in period. 2) Stable Wear Phase AB The wear characteristic of this stage is a low and stable wear rate, which is why the duration of this phase is relatively long. But by mid- Figure 1.3: Wear Characteristic Curve –  Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance 19 Later on, the wear rate becomes relatively faster, but the equipment can still function for a while. When the wear amount reaches point B, the wear rate sharply accelerates, marking the onset of the severe wear phase. Proper usage, along with regular maintenance and upkeep of the equipment, is key to extending this critical stage. 3) Rapid Wear Phase BC Once this stage is reached, significant changes in friction conditions occur, such as altered lubrication or shifts in the geometric dimensions of components. Changes, such as increased clearance between mating parts and the generation of impact loads, can cause wear rates to rise sharply. At this point, mechanical efficiency noticeably declines, and precision deteriorates—conditions that, if left unaddressed, could lead to equipment failure or even unexpected accidents. Therefore, promptly identifying and repairing components that are about to enter this stage is critically important. According to wear results, wear is categorized into pitting wear, adhesive wear, abrasive wear, and more; while based on wear mechanisms, it is classified into abrasive wear, fatigue wear, adhesive wear, fretting wear, and others. Abrasive wear occurs when a hard protruding part on one surface of a friction pair comes into contact with the other surface, or when abrasive particles are present between the two rubbing surfaces. Wear occurs when hard particulates—such as dust in the air or metal particles generated by abrasion—cause material transfer from one surface to another, or even simultaneous material loss on both surfaces, during relative motion. Among the many wear failure modes, abrasive wear is not only the most common but also the most severe type of failure. Fretting wear refers to a type of wear where localized areas on the surfaces of friction pairs develop fatigue cracks under cyclic contact stresses, leading to the detachment of micro-sheets or particles. Depending on the nature of contact and relative motion between the friction pairs, fretting wear can be categorized into two main forms: rolling-contact fatigue wear and sliding-contact fatigue wear. In practical applications, pure rolling-contact fatigue wear is relatively rare; most often, it occurs as a combination of rolling and sliding motions. Adhesive wear occurs when, at the points of contact between mating surfaces, ""cold welding"" takes place, causing material from one surface to transfer to the other during relative sliding. Micro-motion wear is a type of wear that occurs when two contacting objects undergo relative vibrations with very small amplitudes. It happens on two closely matched surfaces that appear nominally stationary but actually experience cyclic, minute-scale relative sliding—typically at the micrometer level (2–20 μm). For instance, this phenomenon can be observed at interference or transition-fit interfaces between shafts and holes, on keyway surfaces, or in threaded fasteners. Wear occurring on working surfaces, such as the working surface of the rivet, and other similar areas. Fretting wear not only reduces mating accuracy, loosens tight-fitting components, and degrades the quality of the mating surfaces, but can also lead to the formation of fatigue cracks, significantly diminishing the fatigue strength of the part. 2. Measures to Prevent or Reduce Wear
29 Record the measured values. (4) Check the machine tool's operational condition: Verify whether the control system responds sensitively and reliably during movement; ensure that all movements meet the specified values; and confirm that the motion is smooth, without vibrations, noise, or stick-slip phenomena. (5) Inspect the machine tool guideways, lead screws, and racks for wear, and measure the extent of the wear. (6) Inspect the hydraulic, pneumatic, and lubrication systems: Verify that movements are accurate, check for any component damage or leaks, and if leaks are present, identify the cause. (7) Inspect the electrical system: Check whether electrical components are aged or malfunctioning. (8) Inspect safety protection devices: Verify that all limit switches and interlock mechanisms are sensitive and reliable, and check whether any of the indicator instruments or protective guards are damaged. (9) Inspect the equipment's appearance and accessories: Check for chipped paint, damage to any handles, ensure all labels are present, and verify that accessories are complete and free from wear or damage. (10) Partial disassembly inspection to determine whether parts need replacement or repair based on their wear condition. During the pre-inspection, especially large and complex castings and forgings, high-precision critical components, and purchased parts must be checked one by one to determine whether they need replacement or repair. Preparing overhaul technical documentation By conducting a pre-inspection to assess the equipment's condition and determine whether repairs or component replacements are necessary, we can then proceed to analyze, develop a repair plan, and prepare the corresponding technical documentation. These technical documents serve as the foundation for major equipment overhauls. Commonly used technical documents for equipment overhauls include the following types: (1) Prepare the equipment maintenance technical specification. The equipment maintenance technical specification should include the following content. ① The technical condition of the equipment before major overhaul. ② Key maintenance activities include detailing the disassembly, cleaning, and inspection of components to identify parts that require repair or replacement; briefly outlining the repair methods for basic and critical components; specifying mechanisms that must be thoroughly inspected and adjusted, as well as other areas requiring attention; and highlighting specific parts and aspects that can be improved during the overhaul process. ③ Maintenance quality requirements: Specify the names and numbers of the general technical standards applicable to each quality inspection during major equipment overhauls, and attach the content of any specialized technical standards to the back of the task specification. (2) Preparing Maintenance Procedures. The maintenance procedures for mechanical equipment are the technical documents that must be carefully followed and implemented during major overhauls. When developing overhaul procedures, it’s essential to consider the actual conditions, ensuring both technical feasibility and economic viability. Mechanical equipment overhaul procedures can be categorized into two types: standard maintenance procedures and specialized maintenance procedures. The overhaul procedures for mechanical equipment typically include the following elements. ① Disassembly procedures and methods for the complete machine and its components, as well as the data to be monitored and precautions to observe during the disassembly process."

If none of the above standards apply, refer to the equipment manufacturer's technical specifications. (4) Preparation of spare parts, materials, and specialized tools, inspection equipment, and research fixtures. The lead technical personnel should promptly provide the management team with detailed lists of replacement parts, material specifications, as well as lists of specialized tools, inspection equipment, and research fixtures, along with relevant drawings. After verifying the inventory, the management team will place orders or arrange for manufacturing to ensure that these items are available on time for use during major equipment overhauls. (5) Preparing the Overhaul Work Plan. The overhaul work plan is prepared by the planning personnel in the maintenance department, who are responsible for equipment management. Personnel, chief technicians, and maintenance foremen (team leaders) review it together. The overhaul work plan includes: work procedures, the number of workers required for each phase and stage of the job, along with the corresponding duration in days; requirements for seamless coordination between individual work phases; and details on projects that need to be outsourced to external partners, including specific timeframes. A general overhaul work plan can be presented using a ""bar chart"" format, supplemented by necessary explanatory text. For overhauls of complex, high-precision, large-scale, and critical equipment, network scheduling techniques should be employed to ensure efficient resource utilization, shorten project timelines, and enhance overall economic benefits. 4. Material Preparation Before Equipment Maintenance Material preparation before equipment maintenance is a critically important task, serving as the essential logistical foundation for successful repairs. In practice, delays often occur due to insufficient availability of spare parts and components, disrupting the normal flow of maintenance work, prolonging downtime, and ultimately leading to inefficiencies and production losses. Therefore, it is imperative to strengthen material preparation efforts prior to equipment maintenance. After the lead maintenance technician has prepared detailed lists of replacement parts and materials, they should promptly hand these over to the responsible personnel managing spare parts and supplies. Once the inventory has been verified, these managers will place orders accordingly. Meanwhile, after finalizing the repair procedures, the lead maintenance technician must immediately provide the tool management team with detailed lists and drawings of specialized tools, inspection devices, and testing equipment. The tool management staff will then cross-check the existing inventory and forward any necessary items—such as specialized tools, inspection devices, or testing equipment—to the relevant departments for evaluation. Based on the evaluation results, if repairs are indeed required, the departments will arrange for the necessary maintenance activities. Additionally, the tool management team will initiate new procurement requests for any additional specialized tools, inspection devices, or testing equipment that may be needed. 1.4.2 General Process for Mechanical Equipment Maintenance
28 Determine the form and compensation method for the error compensation环节, ensuring assembly accuracy among all components—such as parallelism, coaxiality, perpendicularity, and the required meshing precision of the transmission. 3) Post-Repair Acceptance Phase All equipment that has undergone repair, assembly, and adjustment must be subjected to comprehensive precision checks and tests—such as geometric accuracy inspections, no-load running tests, load tests, and working precision evaluations—in accordance with the relevant prescribed accuracy standards or the precision criteria established prior to repair. These measures ensure a thorough assessment of the repaired equipment’s quality, restored precision, and overall performance. After equipment maintenance, record the modifications made to the original technical documentation and document any lessons learned during the repair process. Prepare a thorough post-repair summary and file it alongside the original documents for future reference during the next maintenance task. 2. Determining the Equipment Maintenance Plan Major equipment overhauls must not only meet the predetermined technical requirements but also strive to enhance economic efficiency. Therefore, before starting repairs, it’s essential to thoroughly assess the equipment’s technical condition, develop a practical and feasible repair plan, and ensure comprehensive preparation—both technically and in terms of production readiness. During the repair process, actively incorporate new technologies, materials, processes, and modern management techniques, while diligently managing technical, financial, and organizational aspects to guarantee high-quality workmanship, minimize downtime, and reduce overall maintenance costs. A pre-inspection must be conducted to thoroughly assess the equipment's technical condition before repairs, identify the main defects present, and analyze the product-specific process requirements that influence the equipment's technical specifications—allowing for the immediate development of a repair plan. 3. Technical Preparation Before Equipment Maintenance Preparation for equipment maintenance involves two key aspects: technical preparation and production readiness. The technical preparation prior to maintenance is the responsibility of the lead technician, and its main tasks include pre-inspection planning and research, conducting the actual pre-inspection, and preparing comprehensive overhaul technical documentation. Meanwhile, production readiness before the overhaul is managed by personnel responsible for spare parts, materials, and tools, as well as the production planners from the maintenance unit. Their primary responsibilities encompass ordering, manufacturing, inspecting, and storing critical materials, spare parts, and specialized tools, gauges, and testing equipment—along with developing the overall maintenance production schedule. Pre-inspection survey preparation work To gain a comprehensive understanding of the specific condition of equipment degradation, schedule a shutdown inspection before the major overhaul—this is referred to as a pre-inspection. Before conducting the equipment pre-inspection, ensure the following preparatory investigations are completed. (1) Review the following equipment records: factory inspection reports; precision and performance verification records from equipment installation acceptance tests; details of all past equipment incidents, malfunctions, and repairs, including any remaining issues after repairs; records of all previous maintenance activities, including replaced or repaired components, as well as any unresolved problems left behind after servicing; and operational status monitoring logs and comprehensive equipment inspection records."

③ Having well-equipped maintenance facilities organized according to functional divisions and strategically located for optimal efficiency. The main drawback of the planned preventive maintenance system is its poor cost-effectiveness. With fixed maintenance cycles and scopes, it often leads to unnecessary repairs of certain components—what’s known as over-maintenance. During the maintenance process, repairs are categorized into several levels and types based on the depth and breadth of the work required, including major overhauls, mid-level repairs, minor repairs, item-specific repairs, retrofits, and unplanned maintenance tasks—all determined by the scale and nature of the repair workload. (1) Overhaul: A comprehensive or fundamental restoration of the functionality of mechanical and electrical equipment, typically carried out by specialized maintenance teams within factories and mines —or at repair centers established in regions with a high concentration of industrial facilities. During an overhaul, the equipment is either fully or extensively disassembled, with a focus on repairing critical components, replacing or refurbishing parts that have lost their function or are on the verge of doing so. After the repairs, the equipment’s precision is restored to nearly its original factory specifications, while also receiving a fresh cosmetic overhaul to enhance its appearance. (2) Intermediate Overhaul. This is a level of maintenance that falls between major and minor overhauls, serving as a balanced approach to upkeep. (3) Minor Repair. This involves replacing or repairing components that have significantly worn out or are nearing failure within the maintenance interval, without addressing any underlying structural issues. It is a troubleshooting-based repair aimed at restoring functionality. The three levels—major overhaul, mid-term repair, and minor repair—objectively reflect the chronological progression of机电 equipment, making them ideally suited for implementing time-based planned preventive maintenance, a practice widely adopted by most organizations. However, these levels still require complementary repair tiers to address unforeseen maintenance needs effectively. (4) Item-based maintenance. Based on condition monitoring of mechanical and electrical equipment, this involves proactively planning repairs specifically for components or technical items that are about to fail. Item-based maintenance is conducted between major, medium, and minor overhauls—it’s a non-periodic, planned maintenance level that doesn’t follow a fixed cycle. (5) Retrofitting. This involves making localized modifications to existing mechanical and electrical equipment using new technologies, materials, structures, and processes, with the goal of enhancing its precision, functionality, productivity, and reliability. Such repairs are classified as improvement-oriented, and the extent of the work required depends on how well the original equipment’s design accommodates the retrofitting process—as well as on the specific level of performance enhancement desired for the equipment. Retrofitting is also referred to as modernization or upgrading. (6) Unscheduled Maintenance. This is a level of maintenance required for mechanical and electrical equipment due to sudden breakdowns and accidents. The fewer the number and scope of unscheduled maintenance activities, the higher the level of management.
When designing, it's essential to consider not only the strength of the parts but also their stiffness, as well as issues related to manufacturing, assembly, usage, disassembly, and maintenance. (1) Select materials carefully, paying attention to their process properties—such as casting fluidity and shrinkage, forging ductility and cold-heading capability, weldability characteristics like susceptibility to cold and hot cracking, machinability for ease of cutting, and heat-treatment properties including hardenability and resistance to cold brittleness. (2) Properly arrange the parts to optimize their stress distribution. Select appropriate structural dimensions, ensuring uniform wall thicknesses as much as possible, and minimize deformation during hot working processes. For instance, avoid sharp corners by replacing them with rounded or chamfered edges; for areas with significant thickness variations, consider adding process holes or reinforcing excessively thin sections. Additionally, carefully position any existing holes—transforming blind holes into through-holes where feasible. For parts with complex geometries, whenever possible, opt for modular or assembled designs to further enhance stress management. (3) In the design process, ensure the application of new technologies, processes, and materials to minimize internal stresses and deformation during manufacturing. 2) Manufacturing In the rough casting manufacturing process, it is important to address deformation issues and implement various process measures to minimize residual stresses in the blank. After the raw parts are produced and during subsequent machining processes, it is essential to incorporate sufficient steps for relieving internal stresses, aiming to minimize residual stresses within the components. One effective method to eliminate these residuals is through aging treatment, which can be either natural or artificial. Natural aging involves leaving the finished raw parts exposed outdoors for 1 to 2 years. This approach leverages the material’s inherent property of gradually releasing internal stresses over a period of 12 to 20 months—making it particularly effective—but the main drawback is the excessively long aging cycle. On the other hand, artificial aging accelerates the stress-relief process by subjecting the parts to high-temperature annealing followed by controlled cooling at a slow pace. Alternatively, vibrational techniques can also be employed to achieve artificial aging. For high-precision components, artificial aging must be integrated into the final machining stages to ensure optimal dimensional accuracy and stability. During machining and repair processes, minimize the number of datum shifts, preserving the original machining datums for use during maintenance, thereby reducing repair time. Errors caused by inconsistent benchmarks during machining. For parts that have undergone heat treatment, be sure to allow sufficient machining allowances and adjust the machining dimensions accordingly. Pre-applying controlled deformation is crucial—once the deformation patterns of the part are understood, you can counteract them in advance by introducing an equal but opposite amount of deformation. Alternatively, you can pre-stress the part or carefully manage the generation and evolution of stresses, ensuring that the final deformation aligns with specifications and effectively minimizes distortion. 3) Maintenance Aspects During maintenance, it is essential to not only meet the technical requirements—such as restoring part dimensions, ensuring proper fit tolerances, and achieving high surface quality—but also to inspect and correct any shape or positional errors in critical components. To minimize stress and deformation of parts during repair, standardized guidelines and maintenance procedures specifically addressing deformation issues should be established. Additionally, simple, reliable, and user-friendly specialized measuring tools and fixtures should be designed. Finally, it’s important to actively promote ""three new"" technologies, particularly innovative repair techniques like brush plating and bonding. 4) Usage Instructions

Industries and enterprises may also develop their own specialized quality standards for major equipment repairs based on these relevant general technical guidelines.

⑤ Propose solutions to address the contradictions that have emerged in the above 4 steps. (4) Typically, the equipment maintenance plan for the following year is prepared in September each year. The preparation process follows these 4 steps: ① Gather information. Before drafting the plan, thorough data collection and analysis must be conducted. This primarily involves two key areas: first, technical condition data of the equipment, such as original documentation, equipment inspection forms, product process requirements, and quality-related information, to determine the appropriate maintenance category; and second, the annual production schedule, equipment maintenance quotas, relevant technical specifications for the equipment, and current inventory levels of spare parts. ② Prepare the draft. When drafting, fully consider how the annual production plan impacts equipment requirements, ensuring that maintenance schedules are aligned with production plans. This will help prevent both under-maintenance and over-maintenance of equipment. Before formally submitting the draft annual maintenance plan, the equipment management department, under the leadership of the chief plant manager, should organize a comprehensive technical and economic analysis and evaluation involving departments such as process engineering, technology, operations, and production—aiming to achieve well-balanced, rational objectives. ③ Balanced Approval. After the draft plan is completed, it is distributed to the production, planning, engineering, technical, finance, and user departments for discussion. Participants are invited to propose modifications, such as adding or removing items, adjusting maintenance downtime durations, setting machine-off delivery dates, and revising maintenance categories. Once these inputs are comprehensively evaluated and balanced, the final maintenance plan is formally prepared and submitted to senior management for approval. The maintenance plan must be filled out on the prescribed form, including details such as: the equipment’s basic information (user department, asset number, name, and model), the repair complexity factor, the type or scope of the repair work, time quotas, downtime duration, planned schedule, and the responsible maintenance contractor. Additionally, a plan description should be prepared, highlighting key priorities, identifying potential weak links, and outlining critical issues that need attention. Finally, preliminary measures and recommendations should be proposed to address these crucial challenges effectively. ④ Issue for execution. Before December each year, the enterprise's production planning department will issue the equipment maintenance plan for the following year, serving as the basis for the company's operations. It serves as an important component for evaluating production and business plans."

(1) Different-colored wires should be used for different circuits; if the same  color wire is employed, it must have insulating tubes of different colors fitted at both ends. (2) In the machine tool's control circuit, both ends of the wires should be fitted wi th numerical markers that match the wiring positions indicated on the terminal block.

Precision Inspection of Mechanical Equipment Maintenance After major overhauls of mechanical equipment, acceptance checks are conducted according to established standards, with each type of equipment having its own specific acceptance criteria and inspection methods. Take metal cutting machine tools as an example: the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has established various precision testing standards for different types of machine tools, along with general guidelines for machine tool accuracy verification. Similarly, China has developed its own standards that are either equivalent to or closely aligned with international benchmarks. These standards specify the inspection items, criteria, methods, and tolerances for machine tool accuracy—serving as the fundamental basis for conducting precision tests. Currently, machine tool maintenance is carried out based on both geometric and operational precision standards during acceptance procedures. Inspection of Machine Tool Geometric Accuracy Geometric accuracy of machine tools refers to the precision of the components that ultimately affect the machine's operational accuracy. It encompasses individual accuracies of basic structural elements, positional accuracy between various parts, as well as motion accuracy, positioning accuracy, indexing accuracy, and transmission chain accuracy. Typically, geometric accuracy checks are performed while the machine tool is stationary. Before conducting these inspections, it’s essential to first ensure proper installation and leveling. Follow the machine tool’s instruction manual carefully to install the equipment on a suitable foundation and achieve precise leveling. The primary goal of leveling is to guarantee the machine’s static stability, which facilitates accurate measurements during testing—especially those related to the straightness of machine components. Additionally, national standards have standardized methods for inspecting both geometric and operational accuracy of machine tools, providing a reliable reference for conducting geometric accuracy tests. Machine Tool Testing Since the geometric accuracy of machine tools is checked under static conditions, it cannot fully reflect the quality of machine tool maintenance. To determine  whether a machine tool can maintain its original geometric accuracy under operational conditions and load applications, it must be evaluated through various machine tool tests. Th e key components of machine tool maintenance testing include no-load running tests, load tests, and working precision tests. (1) No-load operation test of the machine tool. The pur pose of the no-load operation test is to further verify the correct functioning of each component of the machine tool. Sex, reliability, ease and normality of operation, as well as  whether the temperature rise and noise levels of each moving component are within acceptable limits. The primary focus of the machine tool's no-load running test is to simultaneou sly check the operational status of relevant parts while testing the spindle and feed speeds. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Mai ntenance 35 Before conducting the no-load operation test of the machine tool, ensure that all major overhaul tasks have been completed and that each repair has met the required qua lity standards. Next, fill all oil reservoirs with lubricant and properly grease all lubrication points. It is crucial to note: Only after completing all necessary preparations in  accordance with the safety operating procedures can you proceed with the no-load tests as outlined by the precision inspection standards specific to the machine tool being used. (2 ) Machine Tool Load Testing. The machine tool load test evaluates whether the machine’s main motion system can achieve the maximum torque and power allowed by the design, as well a s checks if all machine components are functioning properly under these conditions, whether there are any positional changes between parts, and if such changes remain within the pe rmissible limits. Additionally, it ensures that vibrations, noise levels, and temperature rise remain within normal operating ranges. The machine tool load test primarily involves  performing a cutting-load test, where tools and cutting parameters are selected according to specified requirements to machine the surface of test specimens made from a particular  material and in a specific size. During the load test, the spindle speed and feed rate are allowed to deviate by no more than 5% compared to the theoretical values. (3) Machine Too l Working Accuracy Test. The purpose of the machine tool working accuracy test is to determine whether the positional accuracy between the machine’s various components during the m achining process meets the precision requirements of the parts being manufactured. Before the test, its geometric accuracy must be rechecked. The machine tool working accuracy test  involves machining the surface of a specified test piece using cutting tools and appropriate cutting parameters, as outlined in the machine tool accuracy testing standards for wor king precision requirements. The geometric accuracy of the machined workpiece surface must fall within the tolerance range specified by the precision standards of the machine tool  used, and the surface roughness value should not exceed the prescribed standard.
2.3.2 Installation and Maintenance of Sliding Bearings Sliding bearings are characterized by their reliable operation, smooth performance, quietness, strong vibration absorption due to the lubricating oil film, and ability to withstand significant impact loads. Sliding bearings can be categorized into various structural types, such as integral and split designs, as shown in Figure 2.3. Figure 2.3: Sliding Bearing Basic Requirements for Sliding Bearing Installation (1) Before installation, burrs and sharp edges on the parts of the sliding bearing should be removed, and the contact surfaces must be smooth and clean. (2) When installing the bearing housing, the bearing or bushing should be fitted onto the housing and aligned according to the center position of the bushing or shaft sleeve. All bearings on the same transmission shaft must lie on a single axis, with their coaxial error remaining within the specified tolerance range. The bottom surface of the bearing housing must also be properly aligned with the machine components. The contact surfaces should make even, tight contact, and the fixed connections must be secure. During operation, there should be no signs of loosening or shifting. (3) The contact condition between the bearing and the shaft surface can be checked using the dye-penetration method, and the number of contact points must meet the specified requirements. (4) When the axis is rotating, no rotation of the bearing bush or shaft sleeve is permitted. Mechatronics System Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance Case Study Tutorial
7. System Leak Fault Diagnosis and Repair System leaks are categorized into internal and external leaks, and depending on the severity of the  leak, they can manifest in various forms, such as oil film scraping, seepage, dripping, and spraying. Oil film scraping occurs between relatively moving components, like sliding o r reciprocating pairs in rotating parts. Seepage typically happens at the junctions of end covers and valve plates. Dripping is most common around pipe fittings and connections. Sp raying, on the other hand, often results from broken pipes or improperly installed seals.

These measures ensure a thorough assessment of the repaired equipment’s quality, restored precision, and overall performance. After equipment maintenance, record the modifications made to the original technical documentation and document any lessons learned during the repair process. Prepare a thorough post-repair summary and file it alongside the original documents for future reference during the next maintenance task. 2. Determining the Equipment Maintenance Plan Major equipment overhauls must not only meet the predetermined technical requirements but also strive to enhance economic efficiency. Therefore, before starting repairs, it’s essential to thoroughly assess the equipment’s technical condition, develop a practical and feasible repair plan, and ensure comprehensive preparation—both technically and in terms of production readiness. During the repair process, actively incorporate new technologies, materials, processes, and modern management techniques, while diligently managing technical, financial, and organizational aspects to guarantee high-quality workmanship, minimize downtime, and reduce overall maintenance costs. A pre-inspection must be conducted to thoroughly assess the equipment's technical condition before repairs, identify the main defects present, and analyze the product-specific process requirements that influence the equipment's technical specifications—allowing for the immediate development of a repair plan. 3. Technical Preparation Before Equipment Maintenance Preparation for equipment maintenance involves two key aspects: technical preparation and production readiness. The technical preparation prior to maintenance is the responsibility of the lead technician, and its main tasks include pre-inspection planning and research, conducting the actual pre-inspection, and preparing comprehensive overhaul technical documentation. Meanwhile, production readiness before the overhaul is managed by personnel responsible for spare parts, materials, and tools, as well as the production planners from the maintenance unit. Their primary responsibilities encompass ordering, manufacturing, inspecting, and storing critical materials, spare parts, and specialized tools, gauges, and testing equipment—along with developing the overall maintenance production schedule. Pre-inspection survey preparation work To gain a comprehensive understanding of the specific condition of equipment degradation, schedule a shutdown inspection before the major overhaul—this is referred to as a pre-inspection. Before conducting the equipment pre-inspection, ensure the following preparatory investigations are completed. (1) Review the following equipment records: factory inspection reports; precision and performance verification records from equipment installation acceptance tests; details of all past equipment incidents, malfunctions, and repairs, including any remaining issues after repairs; records of all previous maintenance activities, including replaced or repaired components, as well as any unresolved problems left behind after servicing; and operational status monitoring logs and comprehensive equipment inspection records.
3.1.2 Analysis  of Failure Causes in the Hydraulic System Hydraulic systems can experience a wide range of failures during operation, with the primary causes rooted in issues related to design, m anufacturing, usage practices, and hydraulic oil contamination. Among hydraulic component failures, the hydraulic pump accounts for the highest failure rate—approximately 30% of al l hydraulic component malfunctions—making it essential to pay close attention to this issue. Additionally, many hydraulic system failures are also caused by improper selection of w orking fluids or inadequate maintenance practices. In fact, 70% to 80% of all hydraulic system failures are directly linked to contaminants present in the hydraulic oil, and among these oil-related failures, about 90% are attributed to impurities. Another significant cause of failure stems from natural wear, aging, and degradation that occur under normal operating conditions. Impurities pose a serious threat to hydraulic systems, as they can accelerate component wear, increase leakage, impair system performance, and shorten component lifespan—even leading to equipment damage or complete system failure. The following sections will focus on analyzing failures caused by improper design, manufacturing processes, incorrect usage practices, and hydraulic oil contamination."

The steps for fracture failure analysis are generally as follows. 1) On-site recording and photography After a major equipment accident occurs, promptly investigate and understand all circumstances before and after the incident, and take photographs or videos if necessary. Unless there are casualties requiring immediate attention, efforts should be made to preserve the scene as much as possible. 2) Analyze the dominant failure component When a critical component fails due to fracture, it often leads to the failure of other related parts and structural elements. In such cases, it’s essential to carefully determine the sequence of events and accurately identify the primary fracture-causing component—otherwise, the analysis results could be misleading. 3) Identify the dominant crack on the primary failure component The dominant failure component may already be fragmented; therefore, the remaining fragments should be collected, carefully pieced together, and analyzed to identify which crack initiated first—this crack is the dominant one. 4) Identifying the Failure Source Area Once the dominant crack is identified, you can then examine the corresponding fracture surface to locate the crack initiation zone. 5) Fracture Surface Treatment If further microscopic analysis of the fracture surface is required, or if it’s necessary to preserve evidence, the fracture surface should be cleaned. Typically, clean with compressed air or alcohol, then dry thoroughly afterward. If long-term storage is required, apply rust-preventive oil or grease and store in a sealed container equipped with a desiccant. 6) Determine the cause of failure
1.4.1 Preparations Before Mechanical Equipment Maintenance Electromechanical equipment occupies a critically important position in the production and operational activities of modern industrial enterprises. To ensure smooth equipment operation and safe production, implementing planned preventive maintenance is an essential component of equipment management and repair practices in industrial companies. This section will cover the detailed process of major equipment overhauls, the determination of equipment repair plans, as well as the technical and material preparations required prior to equipment maintenance. 1. Equipment Major Overhaul Process To ensure the precision and operational performance of mechanical and electrical equipment, preventive scheduled maintenance must be carried out in addition to routine upkeep. Among these preventive measures, major overhauls stand out as a critical task aimed at restoring the equipment's accuracy. Within the category of preventive maintenance, major overhauls—often referred to simply as ""overhauls""—represent the most extensive and time-consuming type of repair. An overhaul involves completely or largely disassembling the equipment, repairing or replacing foundational components, refurbishing mechanical and electrical parts, recalibrating the electrical systems, and finally reassembling and fine-tuning the entire unit. The ultimate goal is to thoroughly eliminate any pre-existing defects and restore the equipment to its specified performance standards. The purpose of precision and performance. The major steps involved in the overhaul of mechanical and electrical equipment typically include: pre-disassembly unit inspection, component removal, component inspection, necessary component disassembly, parts cleaning and examination, component repair and assembly, final assembly, no-load trial operation, load testing, overall machine precision verification, and final acceptance. In practice, these tasks should be carried out according to the overhaul work plan, while also ensuring effective job scheduling, quality control during operations, and thorough completion acceptance. The major overhaul process for mechanical and electrical equipment is typically divided into three stages: pre-repair preparation, the repair process itself, and post-repair acceptance. Pre-repair preparation phase To ensure the repair work proceeds smoothly and accurately, maintenance personnel should carefully listen to operators' requirements for equipment repairs and thoroughly understand the issues affecting the equipment being serviced—such as loss of precision, the extent of wear on major mechanical components, the accuracy of the transmission system, and any visible defects. They should also identify which parts need improvement or modification to meet the equipment’s operational specifications. Additionally, they should review relevant technical documentation, equipment manuals, and previous maintenance records to become familiar with the device’s structural features, transmission system, and original design precision standards. This preparation will enable them to propose comprehensive pre-inspection tasks. Following the pre-inspection, specific repair methods for critical and large components can be determined, allowing for the preparation of specialized tools and precision measuring instruments. Finally, the team must define the post-repair precision testing procedures and establish clear acceptance criteria for trial runs, ensuring all technical preparations are fully in place before proceeding with the complete overhaul of the equipment.

(7) The machine tool's safety guards and protective devices must be complete, secure, and function reliably and sensitively. (8) The machine tool's accuracy must be checked both before and after the load test. For machine tools that do not undergo a load test, accuracy verification should be performed after the no-load running test. 2. Precision Inspection of Mechanical Equipment Maintenance After major overhauls of mechanical equipment, acceptance checks are conducted according to established standards, with each type of equipment having its own specific acceptance criteria and inspection methods. Take metal cutting machine tools as an example: the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has established various precision testing standards for different types of machine tools, along with general guidelines for machine tool accuracy verification. Similarly, China has developed its own standards that are either equivalent to or closely aligned with international benchmarks. These standards specify the inspection items, criteria, methods, and tolerances for machine tool accuracy—serving as the fundamental basis for conducting precision tests. Currently, machine tool maintenance is carried out based on both geometric and operational precision standards during acceptance procedures. Inspection of Machine Tool Geometric Accuracy Geometric accuracy of machine tools refers to the precision of the components that ultimately affect the machine's operational accuracy. It encompasses individual accuracies of basic structural elements, positional accuracy between various parts, as well as motion accuracy, positioning accuracy, indexing accuracy, and transmission chain accuracy. Typically, geometric accuracy checks are performed while the machine tool is stationary. Before conducting these inspections, it’s essential to first ensure proper installation and leveling. Follow the machine tool’s instruction manual carefully to install the equipment on a suitable foundation and achieve precise leveling. The primary goal of leveling is to guarantee the machine’s static stability, which facilitates accurate measurements during testing—especially those related to the straightness of machine components. Additionally, national standards have standardized methods for inspecting both geometric and operational accuracy of machine tools, providing a reliable reference for conducting geometric accuracy tests. Machine Tool Testing Since the geometric accuracy of machine tools is checked under static conditions, it cannot fully reflect the quality of machine tool maintenance. To determine  whether a machine tool can maintain its original geometric accuracy under operational conditions and load applications, it must be evaluated through various machine tool tests. Th e key components of machine tool maintenance testing include no-load running tests, load tests, and working precision tests. (1) No-load operation test of the machine tool. The pur pose of the no-load operation test is to further verify the correct functioning of each component of the machine tool. Sex, reliability, ease and normality of operation, as well as  whether the temperature rise and noise levels of each moving component are within acceptable limits. The primary focus of the machine tool's no-load running test is to simultaneou sly check the operational status of relevant parts while testing the spindle and feed speeds. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Mai ntenance 35 Before conducting the no-load operation test of the machine tool, ensure that all major overhaul tasks have been completed and that each repair has met the required qua lity standards. Next, fill all oil reservoirs with lubricant and properly grease all lubrication points. It is crucial to note: Only after completing all necessary preparations in  accordance with the safety operating procedures can you proceed with the no-load tests as outlined by the precision inspection standards specific to the machine tool being used. (2 ) Machine Tool Load Testing. The machine tool load test evaluates whether the machine’s main motion system can achieve the maximum torque and power allowed by the design, as well a s checks if all machine components are functioning properly under these conditions, whether there are any positional changes between parts, and if such changes remain within the pe rmissible limits. Additionally, it ensures that vibrations, noise levels, and temperature rise remain within normal operating ranges. The machine tool load test primarily involves  performing a cutting-load test, where tools and cutting parameters are selected according to specified requirements to machine the surface of test specimens made from a particular  material and in a specific size. During the load test, the spindle speed and feed rate are allowed to deviate by no more than 5% compared to the theoretical values. (3) Machine Too l Working Accuracy Test. The purpose of the machine tool working accuracy test is to determine whether the positional accuracy between the machine’s various components during the m achining process meets the precision requirements of the parts being manufactured. Before the test, its geometric accuracy must be rechecked. The machine tool working accuracy test  involves machining the surface of a specified test piece using cutting tools and appropriate cutting parameters, as outlined in the machine tool accuracy testing standards for wor king precision requirements. The geometric accuracy of the machined workpiece surface must fall within the tolerance range specified by the precision standards of the machine tool  used, and the surface roughness value should not exceed the prescribed standard.
Management of Maintenance Technical Documentation Equipment maintenance technical documentation primarily comes from the technical materials provided as part of the equipment purchase; materials acquired during use from equipment manufacturers, relevant organizations, scientific bookstores, and more; as well as documents designed, surveyed, and compiled in-house. Management is as described below. (1) Specification standards, including relevant international standards, national standards, departmentally issued standards, as well as applicable laws and regulations. (2) Drawing materials, including instruction manuals for mechanical power equipment within the company, partial equipment manufacturing drawings, maintenance and assembly diagrams, spare parts catalogues, and related technical documentation. (3) Layout Diagram of Power Station Equipment and Power Pipeline Network Diagram. (4) Process documentation, including maintenance procedures, parts repair processes, critical component manufacturing techniques, and drawings for specialized tools and fixtures, etc. (5) Maintenance Quality Standards and Equipment Testing Procedures. (6) General technical files, including equipment manuals, research reports, experimental data, calculation notes, cost analyses, claim reports, standard technical materials, patent documents, and relevant literature, among others. (7) Samples and books, including domestic and international samples, books, periodicals, electronic publications, CDs, floppy disks, photographs, and slides, among others. 2) Management Program Maintenance technical documentation is primarily intended for use within the equipment management system and should generally be managed centrally in a dedicated documentation room. The management process should encompass the entire lifecycle of the materials—covering collection, organization, evaluation, classification, numbering, reproduction (such as drafting), storage, retrieval, and distribution. Effective management of technical documentation requires prioritization: key equipment manuals, along with relevant assembly drawings, electrical schematics, and other critical documents, should be clearly marked for enhanced oversight. Importantly, these priority documents are typically not available for external loan. To facilitate compilation and retrieval, it is necessary to establish a coded indexing system for the data and implement computer-based management. The equipment maintenance manual serves as a comprehensive collection of specialized technical documentation for equipment repair, providing maintenance personnel with essential resources for troubleshooting, diagnosing faults, developing repair strategies, and even manufacturing spare parts when needed. The equipment maintenance manuals are compiled separately for each equipment model, and the manuals should include the following content. (1) Features and Feature Diagrams. The features and feature diagrams include an outline diagram, lifting diagram, installation foundation drawing, and Chapter 1—Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance. 51
② Repai r procedures and work steps, including operational guidelines for each step and the corresponding technical requirements to be achieved. A Tutorial on Diagnostics and Maintenance C ases for Mechatronic Systems 52 ③ Process specification requirements during the repair process. ④ Equipment, fixtures, tools, measuring instruments, and other materials used during  the repair process, as well as the inspection procedures following the repair. Detailed and standardized repair processes and adjustment methods should also be established for the  maintenance of critical, precision components, ensuring the quality of repairs. (4) Repair and Assembly Processes. The main contents of the repair and assembly process specificati ons include preparation for repair and assembly, the sequence for assembling components during repair and overall assembly, repair and assembly methods, analysis of repair dimensio n chains, adjustment and compensation techniques for ensuring repair assembly accuracy, as well as inspection methods. Additionally, the procedures cover inspection and test runs a fter repair and assembly. (5) Employ advanced maintenance techniques. In equipment repair, actively learn cutting-edge maintenance processes and technologies from both domestic and  international sources. Based on the actual conditions of your enterprise, adopt relatively mature new processes and materials to gradually replace outdated techniques. Develop systems and measures for learning, researching, testing, and implementing advanced maintenance technologies, continuously enhancing the company's equipment repair expertise and process capabilities. 3. Quality Management of Equipment Maintenance To ensure the quality of equipment maintenance, quality management should be implemented for equipment repairs. 1) The content of equipment maintenance and quality management (1) Establish quality standards for equipment maintenance. (2) Develop equipment maintenance procedures. (3) Inspection and evaluation of equipment maintenance quality. (4) Strengt hen quality management during the maintenance process. Establish quality control points for critical procedures and encourage participation in grassroots quality management team ac tivities, ensuring thorough implementation of the maintenance process plan. (5) Conduct post-repair customer service and quality feedback activities. (6) Strengthen technical train ing efforts to enhance both technical and managerial skills. 2) Inspection of Equipment Repair Quality Enterprises should establish organizations and assign personnel responsible f or inspecting and evaluating the quality of equipment maintenance. The main aspects of equipment maintenance quality inspection include: ① incoming inspection of purchased spare pa rts and materials; ② process quality control and final inspection of self-made spare parts and repaired components; ③ quality checks on components and assemblies during the equipme nt repair process; ④ visual inspection, trial runs, accuracy assessments, and performance tests conducted after repairs are completed. 3) Quality Assurance System for Equipment Mai ntenance The planning, management, spare parts handling, production oversight, technical administration, financial control, and supply of maintenance materials for equipment repair  form an integrated whole. By effectively organizing and coordinating these various aspects of management, we can establish robust systems—complete with management regulations, ope rational standards, workflow processes, and performance evaluation methods—ultimately creating a comprehensive quality assurance system for equipment maintenance. This ensures high -quality repairs while continuously enhancing our overall maintenance expertise. 1.5.5 Spare Parts Management The process by which enterprises, based on economic and practical prin ciples, determine standard limits for spare parts inventory—such as the quantity of spares to keep in stock, the amount of capital allocated to inventory, and the optimal reserve d uration—after gathering relevant data and conducting both calculations and real-world statistical analysis, is known as  ""reserve quotas. "" Effective spare parts inventory control requires establishing these precise reserve quotas. There is a wide variety of maintenance spare parts, and the prices, demand, inventory  levels, and stockholding durations of these parts vary significantly. Different inventory control methods should be applied to spare parts of varying types and characteristics, as  inventory management must also focus on key priorities. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance 53 The ABC analysis categoriz es inventory spare parts into 3 classes. (1) Class A Spare Parts. Class A spare parts are a small but critical subset of components, characterized by their high importance, challen ging procurement and manufacturing processes, elevated costs, and extended lead times for stockpiling. Although these parts account for approximately 10% of all spare part types, t hey consume around 80% of the total budget allocated to spare parts. Therefore, Class A items require stringent control measures. Employing inventory theory, carefully determine op timal stock levels and ordering schedules, while maintaining minimal safety stock levels. Additionally, strive to reduce order cycles by increasing the frequency of purchases, ther eby accelerating the turnover of spare parts inventory funds. In warehouse management, ensure meticulous recording of all incoming and outgoing spare parts, conduct thorough statis tical analysis and calculations of inventory levels, and rigorously implement preventive measures to protect components against corrosion and rust. (2) Category B spare parts. Thes e have a wider variety than Category A spare parts, accounting for about 25% of the total product range, but they require less capital investment—typically around 15% of the total  funds allocated to spare parts. Category B spare parts usually maintain a higher safety stock level, though their reserves can be managed more flexibly. Additionally, based on main tenance needs, the ordering cycle can be appropriately extended to reduce the frequency of purchases. (3) Category C spare parts. These account for approximately 65% of all part va rieties but represent only about 5% of the total funds allocated to spare parts. For Category C items, inventory levels can be maintained at a slightly higher level based on mainte nance needs, and order lead times can be extended accordingly. The focus of spare parts management should be placed on managing Class A and Class B spare parts."

1.4.3 General Principles and Requirements for Mechanical Equipment Disassembly Any piece of machinery is assembled from numerous components. When machinery requires maintenance, it must first be disassembled so that faulty parts can be repaired or replaced. The primary purpose of dismantling machinery is to facilitate the inspection and repair of its components; in fact, the disassembly process typically accounts for about 20% of the total maintenance workload. Therefore, to ensure high-quality repairs, it’s essential to carefully plan ahead and anticipate potential challenges before starting to take apart the equipment. This way, the dismantling can proceed methodically—following a structured approach that adheres to the following rules and guidelines. Preparations Before Disassembly (1) Selection and Cleanup of the Disassembly Site. Before disassembly, choose an appropriate work area—avoid locations prone to windblown sand or dust. The workspace should be kept free from frequent unauthorized access by unrelated personnel to prevent unnecessary disruptions or accidents. Additionally, ensure that the ground in the work area remains clean, free from dirt, oil, or other contaminants. Prior to entering the disassembly site, all machinery must undergo an external cleaning process to guarantee that the disassembly procedure does not compromise the equipment’s precision. (2) Protective Measures: Before cleaning the exterior of mechanical equipment, electrical devices should be either removed or properly protected to prevent moisture damage. Additionally, parts prone to oxidation and rust should promptly undergo appropriate protective and maintenance measures. (3) Draining the oil before disassembly. Whenever possible, drain the lubricating oil from the machinery while it’s still hot prior to disassembly, ensuring smoother and more efficient removal work. (4) Understand the structure, performance, and operating principles of mechanical equipment. To avoid unnecessary disassembly and ensure the smooth progress of maintenance work, thoroughly assess all aspects of the machinery before dismantling. Familiarize yourself with the structural features of each component, the transmission system, as well as the specific design characteristics and interrelationships of individual parts. Clearly identify their intended functions and how they interact with one another, enabling you to plan the disassembly process logically and select the appropriate tools or equipment for the job.
General Principles for Disassembly (1) Based on the structural characteristics of the mechanical equipment, select a logical disassembly sequence. Typically, the process involves dismantling from the overall unit into subassemblies, then breaking down subassemblies into individual components, and finally separating components into their constituent parts—or alternatively, proceeding from accessories to the main unit and from external elements inward. When disassembling particularly complex components, it’s essential to thoroughly study the assembly drawings and carefully analyze the component’s structure as well as the specific roles its parts play within the assembly. Pay special attention to components that require high precision during assembly. This approach helps prevent confusion, ensures an orderly disassembly process, and ultimately facilitates cleaning, inspection, and identification—laying a solid foundation for effective maintenance work. (2) Rational disassembly. During the maintenance and disassembly of mechanical equipment, adhere to the principle of avoiding unnecessary disassembly while ensuring that components requiring removal are indeed taken apart. (3) Use disassembly tools and equipment correctly. After understanding the steps involved in removing mechanical components, it’s crucial to select and properly apply the appropriate disassembly tools. When dismantling, always opt for specialized or suitably matched tools and equipment whenever possible, avoiding random hammering or forceful techniques to prevent damage or deformation of the parts. For instance, when removing shaft sleeves, rolling bearings, gears, pulleys, and similar components, use pullers or hydraulic presses; and for unscrewing studs or nuts, always prefer wrenches that match their dimensions precisely. Precautions During Disassembly: When performing mechanical equipment maintenance, disassembly should also take into account the subsequent assembly tasks. To ensure a smooth process, keep the following points in mind. (1) Ensure thorough verification or marking of disassembled parts. Mechanical equipment often contains numerous precisely matched components and parts, many of which have been specifically selected or balanced for weight—meaning their assembly positions and orientations must not be altered under any circumstances. Therefore, when dismantling, carefully check parts that already bear original markings. If these markings are unclear, misaligned, or missing altogether, re-mark them exactly as they were originally to ensure proper alignment during reassembly, preventing any confusion or errors. (2) Store parts by category. When storing disassembled parts, follow these principles: Parts belonging to the same type or component should be kept together whenever possible; store items according to their size and precision level; non-interchangeable parts must be stored separately in groups; delicate components that are sensitive to dirt or damage should be removed and stored individually; rubber parts should never be stored alongside oil-bearing components; and ensure that easily lost items are carefully accounted for. Parts such as washers and nuts should be strung together with wire or stored in dedicated containers; all types of studs must be fitted with nuts before being placed in storage. Additionally, parts like steel components, aluminum items, rubber pieces, and leather goods should be stored separately in different containers, categorized by their respective material types. (3) Protect the machined surfaces of removed parts. During disassembly, never damage the machined surfaces of the components being taken apart—doing so could complicate repair work and lead to issues such as air, oil, or water leaks, ultimately resulting in reduced performance of the mechanical equipment. 1.4.4 Disassembly Methods for Commonly Used Components The disassembly of commonly used components should follow general disassembly principles, while also considering their specific characteristics and employing appropriate methods tailored to each component in order to achieve the intended purpose.
2) Key Points for Process Specification Work (1) Disassembly process. When repairing mechanical equipment, the first step is to partially disassemble and take it apart. However, each time a machine is disassembled, its performance and precision inevitably suffer some degree of damage. Improper disassembly of precision equipment can even lead to complete报废 of the device. Therefore, it is crucial to approach this process with utmost care and expertise. Key and precision equipment should have dismantling process specifications developed. The general principles and precautions for disassembly will be introduced in Chapter 2 and can serve as a reference when developing the disassembly process. Additionally, please keep the following points in mind. ① Safety comes first during disassembly. Before starting, ensure the power supply is disconnected, remove any hazardous materials—such as toxic or flammable substances—from both inside and outside the machinery and equipment, set up reliable supports, and select appropriate lifting equipment and tools. ② Disassembly for service and maintenance. Do not disassemble components that are unnecessary or prohibited. For parts with tight fits, establish a proper disassembly method and use appropriate tools to avoid damaging critical surfaces. ③ Disassembly serves assembly. When the machine structure is complex and the drawing documentation is incomplete, disassemble while simultaneously documenting details and sketching preliminary diagrams, ultimately compiling a complete assembly drawing.
(1) The work area for disassembly and cleaning must be kept clean; dusty environments or outdoor locations are prohibited. If it is necessary to carry out the work outdoors, dust-control measures must be implemented. (2) Before disassembly, you must familiarize yourself with the drawings. Proceed step-by-step according to the diagrams, and mark the mating components clearly, ensuring that the markings are consistent, unambiguous, and easily visible. If the components already have existing marks, verify them thoroughly before proceeding with disassembly. When disassembling identical yet numerous components, provide a schematic diagram and mark them according to the numbers shown on the diagram. (3) Removed parts must be stored properly and protected from moisture, damage, or loss."

Disassembly of the Spindle Assembly To prevent reduced assembly accuracy due to improper disassembly, mark the relative positions of bearings, washers, tool housings, and spindles around the circumference during removal. After disassembling, group each bearing along with its corresponding inner and outer washers separately and store them in distinct locations—do not mix them up. Ensure that the workbench and surrounding area at the disassembly site remain clean, and immediately place all removed parts into oil to prevent rusting. When reassembling, be sure to reinstall them according to their original marked orientations. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment
2) Key Points for Process Specification Work (1) Disassembly process. When repairing mechanical equipment, the first step is to partially disassemble and take it apart. However, each time a machine is disassembled, its performance and precision inevitably suffer some degree of damage. Improper disassembly of precision equipment can even lead to complete报废 of the device. Therefore, it is crucial to approach this process with utmost care and expertise. Key and precision equipment should have dismantling process specifications developed. The general principles and precautions for disassembly will be introduced in Chapter 2 and can serve as a reference when developing the disassembly process. Additionally, please keep the following points in mind. ① Safety comes first during disassembly. Before starting, ensure the power supply is disconnected, remove any hazardous materials—such as toxic or flammable substances—from both inside and outside the machinery and equipment, set up reliable supports, and select appropriate lifting equipment and tools. ② Disassembly for service and maintenance. Do not disassemble components that are unnecessary or prohibited. For parts with tight fits, establish a proper disassembly method and use appropriate tools to avoid damaging critical surfaces. ③ Disassembly serves assembly. When the machine structure is complex and the drawing documentation is incomplete, disassemble while simultaneously documenting details and sketching preliminary diagrams, ultimately compiling a complete assembly drawing. (2) Parts cleaning process. The cleaning process should include details such as the cleaning method, cleaning procedure, type or formulation of the cleaning agent, cleaning parameters, cleaning quality, and important precautions during cleaning. (3) Repair Processes for Typical Components. In equipment maintenance, certain critical parts—such as machine beds, housings, worktables, and large rotating components—often require restoration. To ensure effective repairs and enhance overall efficiency, it’s essential to select the appropriate repair solution and develop a detailed maintenance process procedure. These procedures are typically documented in the form of process cards, which provide more specifics than standard manufacturing process cards yet remain simpler than operation-specific cards. A typical maintenance process card usually includes the following information: ① Part name, drawing number, material and properties, part defect indication diagram, and explanations regarding the defects.
(4) For components that need to be heated before removal, the heating temperature should be maintained according to the design specifications or the equipment manufacturer’s instructions. (5) Machine parts are typically cleaned with kerosene, but precision components or rolling bearings must be washed again with gasoline after being thoroughly cleaned with kerosene. (6) All debris such as sediment, sand, or dirty oil inside oil holes and oil passages must be thoroughly removed, and then sealed with wooden plugs—never use cotton yarn or cloth scraps as substitutes for the plugs. (7) After cleaning, mechanical equipment components that cannot be assembled immediately should be properly stored to prevent dust from entering. (8) When assembling equipment components, first inspect the surface shapes and dimensional accuracy of parts relevant to the assembly. Only proceed with assembly after confirming they meet the required specifications."

General Principles for Disassembly (1) Based on the structural characteristics of the mechanical equipment, select a logical disassembly sequence. Typically, the process involves dismantling from the overall unit into subassemblies, then breaking down subassemblies into individual components, and finally separating components into their constituent parts—or alternatively, proceeding from accessories to the main unit and from external elements inward. When disassembling particularly complex components, it’s essential to thoroughly study the assembly drawings and carefully analyze the component’s structure as well as the specific roles its parts play within the assembly. Pay special attention to components that require high precision during assembly. This approach helps prevent confusion, ensures an orderly disassembly process, and ultimately facilitates cleaning, inspection, and identification—laying a solid foundation for effective maintenance work. (2) Rational disassembly. During the maintenance and disassembly of mechanical equipment, adhere to the principle of avoiding unnecessary disassembly while ensuring that components requiring removal are indeed taken apart. (3) Use disassembly tools and equipment correctly. After understanding the steps involved in removing mechanical components, it’s crucial to select and properly apply the appropriate disassembly tools. When dismantling, always opt for specialized or suitably matched tools and equipment whenever possible, avoiding random hammering or forceful techniques to prevent damage or deformation of the parts. For instance, when removing shaft sleeves, rolling bearings, gears, pulleys, and similar components, use pullers or hydraulic presses; and for unscrewing studs or nuts, always prefer wrenches that match their dimensions precisely. Precautions During Disassembly: When performing mechanical equipment maintenance, disassembly should also take into account the subsequent assembly tasks. To ensure a smooth process, keep the following points in mind. (1) Ensure thorough verification or marking of disassembled parts. Mechanical equipment often contains numerous precisely matched components and parts, many of which have been specifically selected or balanced for weight—meaning their assembly positions and orientations must not be altered under any circumstances. Therefore, when dismantling, carefully check parts that already bear original markings. If these markings are unclear, misaligned, or missing altogether, re-mark them exactly as they were originally to ensure proper alignment during reassembly, preventing any confusion or errors. (2) Store parts by category. When storing disassembled parts, follow these principles: Parts belonging to the same type or component should be kept together whenever possible; store items according to their size and precision level; non-interchangeable parts must be stored separately in groups; delicate components that are sensitive to dirt or damage should be removed and stored individually; rubber parts should never be stored alongside oil-bearing components; and ensure that easily lost items are carefully accounted for. Parts such as washers and nuts should be strung together with wire or stored in dedicated containers; all types of studs must be fitted with nuts before being placed in storage. Additionally, parts like steel components, aluminum items, rubber pieces, and leather goods should be stored separately in different containers, categorized by their respective material types. (3) Protect the machined surfaces of removed parts. During disassembly, never damage the machined surfaces of the components being taken apart—doing so could complicate repair work and lead to issues such as air, oil, or water leaks, ultimately resulting in reduced performance of the mechanical equipment. 1.4.4 Disassembly Methods for Commonly Used Components The disassembly of commonly used components should follow general disassembly principles, while also considering their specific characteristics and employing appropriate methods tailored to each component in order to achieve the intended purpose. 1.4.3 General Principles and Requirements for Mechanical Equipment Disassembly Any piece of machinery is assembled from numerous components. When machinery requires maintenance, it must first be disassembled so that faulty parts can be repaired or replaced. The primary purpose of dismantling machinery is to facilitate the inspection and repair of its components; in fact, the disassembly process typically accounts for about 20% of the total maintenance workload. Therefore, to ensure high-quality repairs, it’s essential to carefully plan ahead and anticipate potential challenges before starting to take apart the equipment. This way, the dismantling can proceed methodically—following a structured approach that adheres to the following rules and guidelines. Preparations Before Disassembly (1) Selection and Cleanup of the Disassembly Site. Before disassembly, choose an appropriate work area—avoid locations prone to windblown sand or dust. The workspace should be kept free from frequent unauthorized access by unrelated personnel to prevent unnecessary disruptions or accidents. Additionally, ensure that the ground in the work area remains clean, free from dirt, oil, or other contaminants. Prior to entering the disassembly site, all machinery must undergo an external cleaning process to guarantee that the disassembly procedure does not compromise the equipment’s precision. (2) Protective Measures: Before cleaning the exterior of mechanical equipment, electrical devices should be either removed or properly protected to prevent moisture damage. Additionally, parts prone to oxidation and rust should promptly undergo appropriate protective and maintenance measures. (3) Draining the oil before disassembly. Whenever possible, drain the lubricating oil from the machinery while it’s still hot prior to disassembly, ensuring smoother and more efficient removal work. (4) Understand the structure, performance, and operating principles of mechanical equipment. To avoid unnecessary disassembly and ensure the smooth progress of maintenance work, thoroughly assess all aspects of the machinery before dismantling. Familiarize yourself with the structural features of each component, the transmission system, as well as the specific design characteristics and interrelationships of individual parts. Clearly identify their intended functions and how they interact with one another, enabling you to plan the disassembly process logically and select the appropriate tools or equipment for the job. (1) The work area for disassembly and cleaning must be kept clean; dusty environments or outdoor locations are prohibited. If it is necessary to carry out the work outdoors, dust-control measures must be implemented. (2) Before disassembly, you must familiarize yourself with the drawings. Proceed step-by-step according to the diagrams, and mark the mating components clearly, ensuring that the markings are consistent, unambiguous, and easily visible. If the components already have existing marks, verify them thoroughly before proceeding with disassembly. When disassembling identical yet numerous components, provide a schematic diagram and mark them according to the numbers shown on the diagram. (3) Removed parts must be stored properly and protected from moisture, damage, or loss."

To prevent errors introduced during reassembly from remaining unresolved, a mark is made at the mating points of the two gears during disassembly, ensuring that the original precision can be restored during reassembly. Removing Axially Positioned Parts
When disassembling shaft components from the gearbox, it is essential to first determine the direction of the shaft's steps, which will dictate the movement direction during removal. Next, remove the shaft caps at both ends, along with any axial positioning parts on the shaft, such as set screws, locknuts, spring washers, and retaining springs. Disassembling Threaded Connections In mechanical equipment, threaded connections are the most widely used method of joining components. They offer advantages such as simple structure, convenient adjustment, and the ability to be repeatedly disassembled and reassembled. While these connections are relatively easy to dismantle, improper handling—such as insufficient attention, incorrect tool selection, or improper dismantling techniques—often leads to damage. Therefore, when removing threaded fasteners, it’s crucial to use the right wrench or screwdriver; always avoid using adjustable wrenches whenever possible. For particularly tough-to-remove threaded joints, first determine the direction of the thread rotation, and never force the connection by twisting randomly or applying excessive leverage with an overly long extension bar. When removing double-ended studs, always use a specialized wrench designed specifically for this purpose. Disassembling Interference-Fit Components When disassembling interference-fit components, select the appropriate removal method, tools, and equipment based on the part's fit dimensions and the size of the interference. Suitable options include pullers, presses, and other specialized tools. Avoid directly striking components with a steel hammer to prevent damage. If no dedicated tools are available, you can use a wooden mallet, copper mallet, or plastic hammer, or alternatively, tap gently using a wooden (or block-shaped) or copper (or block-shaped) rod as a cushion against the steel hammer. Disassembling rolling bearings falls under the category of removing interference-fit components; this process is particularly versatile due to the unique characteristics of these bearings.

Suitable options include pullers, presses, and other specialized tools. Avoid directly striking components with a steel hammer to prevent damage. 2.1.2 Methods for Disassembling Shaft-Type Components
Removal Method (1) Striking and Disengaging. Striking involves using the force of a hammer to create relative movement between mating parts, allowing them to separate and achieve disassembly. This is a straightforward method suitable for simpler structures or when dealing with robust, non-critical components. (2) Press and pull disassembly. Press and pull methods are superior to impact disassembly because they apply force more evenly, allowing precise control over both the magnitude and direction of the force. As a result, these techniques reduce the risk of part misalignment or damage. This method is particularly suitable for dismantling larger components or parts with significant interference fits. (3) Hot disassembly. Hot disassembly leverages the thermal expansion properties of metals to separate parts, preventing issues like parts getting stuck or damaged—something that can occur with methods like impact or press disassembly. This technique is commonly used when the interference fit is significant (exceeding 0.1 mm), the components are large in size, or traditional disassembly methods prove impractical. In summary, choose the appropriate removal method based on how the parts fit together."

Context:  
When disassembling shaft components from the gearbox, it is essential to first determine the direction of the shaft's steps, which will dictate the movement direction during removal. Next, remove the shaft caps at both ends, along with any axial positioning parts on the shaft, such as set screws, locknuts, spring washers, and retaining springs. Disassembling Threaded Connections In mechanical equipment, threaded connections are the most widely used method of joining components. They offer advantages such as simple structure, convenient adjustment, and the ability to be repeatedly disassembled and reassembled. While these connections are relatively easy to dismantle, improper handling—such as insufficient attention, incorrect tool selection, or improper dismantling techniques—often leads to damage. Therefore, when removing threaded fasteners, it’s crucial to use the right wrench or screwdriver; always avoid using adjustable wrenches whenever possible. For particularly tough-to-remove threaded joints, first determine the direction of the thread rotation, and never force the connection by twisting randomly or applying excessive leverage with an overly long extension bar. When removing double-ended studs, always use a specialized wrench designed specifically for this purpose. Disassembling Interference-Fit Components When disassembling interference-fit components, select the appropriate removal method, tools, and equipment based on the part's fit dimensions and the size of the interference. Suitable options include pullers, presses, and other specialized tools. Avoid directly striking components with a steel hammer to prevent damage. If no dedicated tools are available, you can use a wooden mallet, copper mallet, or plastic hammer, or alternatively, tap gently using a wooden (or block-shaped) or copper (or block-shaped) rod as a cushion against the steel hammer. Disassembling rolling bearings falls under the category of removing interference-fit components; this process is particularly versatile due to the unique characteristics of these bearings. Therefore, when disassembling, you must not only follow the key points for removing interference-fit components but also take into account their unique characteristics.
General Principles for Disassembly (1) Based on the structural characteristics of the mechanical equipment, select a logical disassembly sequence. Typically, the process involves dismantling from the overall unit into subassemblies, then breaking down subassemblies into individual components, and finally separating components into their constituent parts—or alternatively, proceeding from accessories to the main unit and from external elements inward. When disassembling particularly complex components, it’s essential to thoroughly study the assembly drawings and carefully analyze the component’s structure as well as the specific roles its parts play within the assembly. Pay special attention to components that require high precision during assembly. This approach helps prevent confusion, ensures an orderly disassembly process, and ultimately facilitates cleaning, inspection, and identification—laying a solid foundation for effective maintenance work. (2) Rational disassembly. During the maintenance and disassembly of mechanical equipment, adhere to the principle of avoiding unnecessary disassembly while ensuring that components requiring removal are indeed taken apart. (3) Use disassembly tools and equipment correctly. After understanding the steps involved in removing mechanical components, it’s crucial to select and properly apply the appropriate disassembly tools. When dismantling, always opt for specialized or suitably matched tools and equipment whenever possible, avoiding random hammering or forceful techniques to prevent damage or deformation of the parts. For instance, when removing shaft sleeves, rolling bearings, gears, pulleys, and similar components, use pullers or hydraulic presses; and for unscrewing studs or nuts, always prefer wrenches that match their dimensions precisely. Precautions During Disassembly: When performing mechanical equipment maintenance, disassembly should also take into account the subsequent assembly tasks. To ensure a smooth process, keep the following points in mind. (1) Ensure thorough verification or marking of disassembled parts. Mechanical equipment often contains numerous precisely matched components and parts, many of which have been specifically selected or balanced for weight—meaning their assembly positions and orientations must not be altered under any circumstances. Therefore, when dismantling, carefully check parts that already bear original markings. If these markings are unclear, misaligned, or missing altogether, re-mark them exactly as they were originally to ensure proper alignment during reassembly, preventing any confusion or errors. (2) Store parts by category. When storing disassembled parts, follow these principles: Parts belonging to the same type or component should be kept together whenever possible; store items according to their size and precision level; non-interchangeable parts must be stored separately in groups; delicate components that are sensitive to dirt or damage should be removed and stored individually; rubber parts should never be stored alongside oil-bearing components; and ensure that easily lost items are carefully accounted for. Parts such as washers and nuts should be strung together with wire or stored in dedicated containers; all types of studs must be fitted with nuts before being placed in storage. Additionally, parts like steel components, aluminum items, rubber pieces, and leather goods should be stored separately in different containers, categorized by their respective material types. (3) Protect the machined surfaces of removed parts. During disassembly, never damage the machined surfaces of the components being taken apart—doing so could complicate repair work and lead to issues such as air, oil, or water leaks, ultimately resulting in reduced performance of the mechanical equipment. 1.4.4 Disassembly Methods for Commonly Used Components The disassembly of commonly used components should follow general disassembly principles, while also considering their specific characteristics and employing appropriate methods tailored to each component in order to achieve the intended purpose. 1. Disassembly of the Spindle Assembly To prevent reduced assembly accuracy due to improper disassembly, mark the relative positions of bearings, washers, tool housings, and spindles around the circumference during removal. After disassembling, group each bearing along with its corresponding inner and outer washers separately and store them in distinct locations—do not mix them up. Ensure that the workbench and surrounding area at the disassembly site remain clean, and immediately place all removed parts into oil to prevent rusting. When reassembling, be sure to reinstall them according to their original marked orientations. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment
1) Valve body disassembly (1) Clamp the valve body in a vise with the threaded plug facing upward (note: ensure the vise jaws do not damage the mating surfaces). (2) Use a wrench to remove and install the threaded plug (be careful not to let the spring pop out), then take out the main valve core and the spring. 2) Assembly of the relief valve (1) Carefully clean all removed parts with kerosene, replace any damaged or worn components (such as sealing rings), and then reassemble in the reverse order of disassembly.

Incorrectly editing the program or steps will lead to accidents. Use the storage protection feature to safeguard completed programs against accidental editing. After completing the teaching operation, manually check the robot's status at low speed. If the robot is immediately operated in automatic mode at 100% speed, factors such as program errors could lead to accidents. After the teaching operation is completed, cleaning should be carried out immediately, and ensure that all tools have been put away. Any oil spills or leftover tools in the work area can easily lead to safety hazards such as slips and falls. Ensure safety during the cleaning process. Please secure the robotic arm before removing the motor. Please secure the robotic arm before removing the motor. 1.2 Transporting, transferring, or selling the robot Unless the original sales contract includes specific provisions, safety-related terms will not be inherited by the new recipient when the robot is transported, transferred, or sold overseas. The original customer should sign a new contract with the new successor. When transporting, transferring, or selling this robot, please ensure that the operation manual, maintenance guide, and any other relevant documents included with the device are also handed over to the new user. Customers are responsible for preparing operation and maintenance manuals in the appropriate language, as well as changing the display language, when shipping, transferring, or exporting robots to foreign countries—and must also ensure compliance with local laws and regulations. New users, without reading the operation manual, may perform improper or unsafe actions, potentially leading to accidents. 1.3 Abandoned Robots Do not disassemble, heat, or incinerate the batteries used in control devices and the robot body, as this may cause fire, rupture, or combustion. After disassembly, do not discard the control unit's baseplate and components directly, as sharp edges from cracks, cuts, or other damaged areas, along with exposed wires, could cause injury. Please remove the cables and external circuit wires from the connectors and junction boxes, then discard them directly—no further disassembly is required. Otherwise, operators could risk cuts to their hands or eyes from sharp conductors or other objects. Please exercise caution during the disposal process to avoid pinching or getting injured. Discarded items should be disposed of safely. To prevent environmental pollution, waste materials such as used batteries and waste oils should be properly managed according to local environmental regulations. 2 Basic Instructions

What factors should be considered when selecting a repair technique for mechanical parts?,"['When repairing damage or defects in mechanical parts, several methods and techniques may be available, but determining the best approach depends on considering the following factors.', '(1) Consider the compatibility of the selected repair technique with the part material.', '(2) Consider the patching layer thicknesses that each repair technique can provide.']","Two primary factors must be considered when selecting a repair technique for mechanical parts.

Context:  
During operation,机电设备 inevitably experience gradual wear, deformation, fracture, corrosion, and other forms of failure in their components. As a result, the equipment's precision, performance, and productivity decline, potentially leading to malfunctions, accidents, or even complete报废 (scrapping). This underscores the critical need for timely maintenance and repairs. In restorative maintenance, all measures are aimed at restoring the equipment as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. Effectively eliminate failures to enhance the equipment's overall utilization rate. Additionally, implementing repair techniques to restore failed components can efficiently achieve this goal. When repairing damage or defects in mechanical parts, several methods and techniques may be available, but determining the best approach depends on considering the following factors. (1) Consider the compatibility of the selected repair technique with the part material. When choosing a repair method, the first step should be to determine whether the technique is suitable for the material of the component being repaired. For instance, manual arc welding is ideal for low-carbon steel, medium-carbon steel, and alloy structural steels—A Case Study Guide for Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Mechanical and Electrical Systems. 38 And stainless steel. Arc surfacing under a flux layer is suitable for low-carbon and medium-carbon steels. Chrome plating technology works well with carbon structural steels, alloy structural steels, stainless steels, and gray cast iron. Bonded repair methods can firmly join parts made of various metallic and non-metallic materials. Spray coating has a broad applicability—almost any type of metal part, including carbon steel, alloy steel, cast iron components, and the vast majority of non-ferrous metal parts, can be coated. However, among metals, only a few non-ferrous materials pose challenges for spraying, such as pure copper; additionally, materials primarily composed of tungsten or molybdenum are also difficult to coat effectively. (2) Consider the patching layer thicknesses that each repair technique can provide. Since the degree of wear varies across different parts, the required thickness of the repair layer to compensate for wear will also differ. Therefore, when selecting a repair technique, it’s important to understand the maximum patching layer thickness achievable by each method.
(3) The mechanical properties of the repair layer—such as its strength and hardness—as well as the bond strength between the repair layer and the component, and the changes in surface strength of the part after repair—are critical indicators for evaluating repair quality and serve as the basis for selecting the appropriate restoration technique. (4) Consider the operating conditions and requirements of the mechanical parts. When selecting a repair technique, the working condition of the part should be taken into account. For example, For example, when mechanical parts operate under rolling conditions, the contact surfaces between the two components experience high contact stresses, making repair techniques like chrome plating, spray welding, and overlay welding particularly suitable. In contrast, when mechanical parts function under sliding conditions—where contact stresses are lower—the range of applicable repair technologies becomes much broader. When selecting a repair technique, it’s important to consider whether the mechanical part can still meet operational requirements after restoration. For instance, if the chosen repair method involves high temperatures during application—such as gas welding or electric welding—it may cause annealing of the mechanical component, compromising the original surface’s heat-treated properties and increasing thermal deformation and residual stresses. Techniques like patch welding or buildup welding, which involve high-temperature processes, are therefore best suited only for non-quenched parts, components that undergo post-weld machining or reshaping, or parts requiring subsequent heat treatment after welding. (5) Consider production feasibility. When selecting repair technologies, it’s essential to take into account the practicality of production, aligning the choice with the existing equipment in the company’s repair workshop, the current level of repair expertise, and the efficiency of the repair production management system. (6) Consider cost-effectiveness. When selecting a repair technique, economic factors should be taken into account. The repair cost of the part and the extended service life after repair should be combined to comprehensively evaluate and measure the economic viability of the chosen repair method. When selecting a parts repair process, it’s essential to consider multiple factors comprehensively rather than focusing on just one aspect. On one hand, you must evaluate the technical requirements of the part being repaired; on the other hand, you should assess the specific characteristics of the repair process itself. Additionally, it’s crucial to align the chosen method with your company’s existing repair capabilities and technical expertise. By doing so, you can ensure the process is both technically sound, economically viable, and practically feasible—ultimately leading to the optimal repair solution."

Repair Dimension Method For certain mating dimensions, wear and other factors can alter the nature of the fit, leading to component failure. In such cases, cutting processes or other methods can be employed to restore the shape accuracy, positional accuracy, surface roughness, and other technical specifications of the worn areas on the primary part. Meanwhile, the complementary, simpler component—whether a new part manufactured to the correct dimensions while maintaining its original fit characteristics, or a repaired version—is produced accordingly. The dimension obtained after this reconditioning process is referred to as the ""repair size."" This approach is economically advantageous and ensures consistent quality since it involves machining directly on the existing component. However, it does reduce the strength and rigidity of the part, and it also necessitates replacing or repairing the mating component, thereby complicating the interchangeability of parts. The repair dimensioning method is primarily used to restore parts with relatively complex structures, while the corresponding complementary part is typically simpler—such as journal bearings, transmission threads, keyways, or sliding guides. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment 39 2. Inlaying Component Method After localized wear of a part, and provided the structure and strength allow, add a component to compensate for the portion removed due to wear or repair, thereby restoring the original dimensions and precision. 3. Local Repair and Replacement Method The localized repair and replacement method restores a part's functionality by addressing worn or damaged areas through techniques such as local repairs, adjustments, repositioning, or partial replacements. 4. Plastic Deformation Method By leveraging the plastic deformation properties of metallic materials, this method allows excess material from non-functional areas of a part to be redistributed onto worn regions under specific external forces, thereby restoring the part’s original shape and dimensions. This approach not only alters the part’s geometry but also modifies its mechanical properties and microstructure. The primary techniques include upsetting, extrusion, expansion, and thermal straightening. When repairing low-carbon steel or non-ferrous metal parts that have not undergone heat treatment, plastic deformation can be performed without heating. For medium- and high-carbon steel parts or alloy steel parts, heating is required during plastic deformation repair. In the case of quenched parts undergoing plastic deformation repair, they must first be subjected to high-temperature tempering or annealing. 5. Metal Riveting Method This method uses specially designed connectors made from metal materials to mechanically and securely rejoin cracked or broken machine components into a single unit. It is characterized by being operated at room temperature, preventing thermal deformation and avoiding stress concentrations. The equipment is simple, and the process is easy to perform. Primarily, this technique is used to repair cracks or fractures in large castings—but it is not recommended for thin-walled castings smaller than 8 mm in thickness. There are strong-buckle bonding, tight-buckle bonding, premium-buckle bonding, and thermal-buckle bonding methods. For the specific processes of each bonding method, please refer to the relevant references. 6. Weld Repair Method The process of welding—where two or more materials (either identical or different) are joined permanently by heating, applying pressure, or combining both methods to achieve atomic-level bonding—is known as welding. At its core, this technique involves repairing damaged parts such as those with cracks or fractures, as well as building up wear-resistant and corrosion-resistant weld layers onto the surfaces of failed components. Its primary purpose is to restore most metal parts that have suffered damage due to wear, breakage, cracking, pitting, or other forms of deterioration. The advantages of the welding repair method include high bonding strength, simple welding equipment, mature technology, no limitations on part size, low cost, high efficiency, and great flexibility. The downside is that, due to the high welding temperature, it can easily cause changes in the microstructure, leading to stress and deformation. Additionally, it’s not suitable for repairing parts that require high precision, are slender, or relatively thin, as these components are prone to defects such as porosity, slag inclusion, and cracking. Welding techniques are primarily applied to metallic base materials, with commonly used methods including arc welding, argon arc welding, CO2 shielded welding, oxy-acetylene welding, laser welding, and more. Non-metallic materials like plastics can also be welded using specialized techniques. Future welding processes will focus on developing new welding methods, equipment, and materials to further enhance welding quality, safety, and reliability. This includes improving existing welding energy sources such as arc, plasma arc, electron beam, and laser technologies. Additionally, advancements in electronics and control technologies will be leveraged to optimize the process performance of arcs, while also enabling the development of reliable, lightweight arc-tracking systems. On the other hand, efforts will be made to elevate the level of welding mechanization and automation. For instance, welders will increasingly feature program-controlled or digitally controlled systems. Specialized automated welding machines capable of handling the entire process—from preparation and welding to quality monitoring—will be developed. Moreover, on automated welding production lines, numerically controlled welding manipulators and robots will be widely adopted and scaled up, boosting overall welding productivity while significantly improving workplace hygiene and safety conditions. Case Study Tutorial on Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Mechatronic Systems
Use a metal material with a melting point lower than that of the base material as the brazing filler metal, and heat the workpieces—where the filler metal has been placed—to a temperature above the filler metal's melting point but below the base material's melting point. The method of joining components by using a liquid brazing filler metal that wets the base material at its melting point, fills the joint gap, and then diffuses into the base material to form a strong bond is called brazing. Brazing is divided into hard brazing and soft brazing. Brazing performed using filler metals with melting points above 450°C is commonly referred to as hard brazing, examples include copper brazing and silver brazing; while brazing conducted with filler metals having melting points below 450°C is typically called soft brazing, such as tin soldering and lead soldering. Brazing has the following characteristics: ① It requires lower heating temperatures, resulting in minimal changes to the microstructure and mechanical properties of the workpiece. ② The molten braze filler metal fills the gaps between the metals being joined via capillary action, leading to excellent gas-tightness in the weld. ③ The workpiece experiences little deformation, producing smooth and even joints. ④ Can join dissimilar materials. ⑤ Low weld strength. Brazing methods can technically be divided into two types: soldering iron brazing and flame brazing. (1) Soldering with a soldering iron. The solder and the area to be welded are heated using an electric soldering iron, making it suitable for soft soldering applications where temperatures remain below 300°C—such as with tin-lead or lead-based solders. When soldering thin or small components, a flux is typically required. The power rating of the soldering iron should be selected based on the type of solder, the material of the workpiece, and the shape and size of the component. (2) Flame brazing. This method uses a flame to heat the braze alloy and the area to be joined, making it suitable for hard brazing applications where temperatures exceed 300°C. It is particularly ideal for workpieces whose shape, size, or equipment constraints make other brazing methods impractical. Commonly used brazing alloys include copper-zinc, copper-phosphorus, silver-based, aluminum-based, and zinc-aluminum alloys, enabling the joining of materials such as steel, stainless steel, cemented carbides, cast iron, copper, silver, aluminum, and their respective alloys. Since brazed joints typically exhibit lower strength compared to other welding techniques, brazing is generally recommended for repairing cracks and fractures in components that do not require high structural integrity. Additionally, designing and selecting an appropriate joint configuration is crucial to enhance the overall strength of the assembly. Brazing is especially well-suited for addressing localized defects—such as abrasions or scratches—on low-speed moving parts. 7. Electroplating Repair Technology Electroplating is a process that uses electrolysis to deposit metal onto the surface of a part, forming a metallic coating. The electroplating repair method not only restores the dimensions of worn parts but also enhances their surface quality—particularly improving wear resistance and corrosion resistance. Electroplating repair technology is a widely used technique for restoring component dimensions under low-temperature conditions. Compared to welding repair methods, it avoids the various issues caused by localized high temperatures, while the bond strength between the electroplated layer and the substrate is nearly equivalent to that achieved with welding repairs. This technique leverages the principle of electrolysis: metal ions from the plating solution are reduced into metallic atoms, which then deposit onto the metal surface, forming a repair layer with strong adhesion and precise thickness control. Common applications include chrome plating, low-temperature iron plating, and brush plating. 8. Thermal Spraying and Spray Welding Repair Method Thermal Spray Repair Technology Thermal spraying technology involves using a heat source to melt or partially melt the coating material, which is then sprayed onto a pre-treated substrate surface at a controlled speed, forming a coating that bonds firmly to the base material of the workpiece. Utilizing thermal spray repair technology allows for the creation of a specialized working surface on ordinary materials, enabling them to achieve a variety of functions such as corrosion resistance, wear resistance, friction reduction, high-temperature protection, antioxidant properties, thermal insulation, electrical insulation, conductivity, and even microwave radiation shielding. Thermal spray technology is a key component of surface processing techniques, accounting for approximately one-third of all surface engineering technologies. Based on the type of heat source used to heat the spraying material, thermal spraying can be categorized into: ① Flame-based methods, including flame spraying, detonation spraying, and supersonic spraying; ② Arc-based methods, comprising arc spraying and plasma spraying; ③ Electrothermal methods, such as electro-explosive spraying, induction heating spraying, and capacitive discharge spraying; ④ Laser-based methods, specifically laser spraying.

3) By the rate at which the fault develops (1) Sudden failures. These failures occur unexpectedly and spontaneously, typically independent of the equipment’s usage time. They are often preceded by no obvious warning signs, making them difficult to predict even through early-stage testing or trials. Such failures usually result from a combination of inherent adverse factors within the process system and unpredictable external influences. (2) Gradual failure. These failures develop slowly and typically occur during the later stages of an electromechanical device's useful life. Their likelihood of occurrence is closely tied to the equipment's usage time, and they can often be predicted through early-stage testing or monitoring. Such failures usually result from the gradual progression of issues like corrosion, wear, fatigue, and material aging in the components. 4) By the cause of fault formation (1) Failures caused by operational or management errors, such as using机电 equipment under conditions that deviate from the original design specifications, leading to improper equipment usage. (2) Failures caused by inherent system factors. These typically arise from defects left over from system design or manufacturing—such as residual stresses or localized weak points—or from latent flaws within the materials themselves. Such failures are unpredictable and represent a major cause of sudden, unexpected breakdowns. (3) Natural failures. During the operational and maintenance period, mechanical and electrical equipment may experience failures caused by various external or internal natural factors—such as wear, fracture, corrosion, deformation, creep, aging, and other forms of damage that occur under normal conditions. 5) By the consequences caused by the failure (1) Critical Failure: A failure that endangers personal safety, results in injury or death, causes the scrapping of机电 equipment, or leads to significant financial losses. Examples include frame or body separation, wheel detachment, and complete engine assembly failure. (2) Minor faults. These are issues that affect the normal operation of mechanical and electrical equipment but can be resolved within a relatively short time. Examples include broken drive belts, damaged control handles, cracks or loose welds in sheet metal components, faulty electrical switches, minor leaks, and loose general fasteners. 6) By the period when the fault occurred (1) Early-stage failures. These faults may arise from design, manufacturing, or material defects and typically become apparent shortly after the equipment is first put into operation. Alternatively, certain components—such as gear pairs in gearboxes or other friction-based assemblies—often require an initial ""running-in"" period before their performance gradually improves. Once these early-stage issues are identified, addressed, and optimized, the failure rate tends to decline over time. (2) Failure during the useful life. This refers to failures that occur within a product's effective lifespan, caused by unpredictable, random factors related to both external loads (such as operational conditions) and intrinsic system characteristics (including internal factors like component failures or structural damage). Since equipment typically operates in this condition for most of its lifetime, the failure rate during this period remains relatively constant. Therefore, monitoring and diagnosing failures during this phase is critically important. (3) Late-stage failures (dissipation-phase failures). These typically occur during the latter part of a device's lifespan, often after the equipment has been in use for an extended period—or even beyond its intended service life. Such failures arise due to gradual wear, fatigue, and aging of the equipment's components, leading to a decline in system functionality. Ultimately, this can result in sudden, hazardous, and potentially widespread system breakdowns. During this phase, the failure rate of the equipment tends to increase steadily. To prevent accidents, it’s crucial to monitor and diagnose the system regularly, promptly replacing any identified failing components before they cause a major incident. As illustrated by the classification of these failures, mechanical and electrical equipment malfunctions are often interconnected and can evolve over time—shifting from one type of failure to another. Ultimately, every type of machinery and equipment failure will manifest as a specific issue, underscoring the importance of comprehensive diagnostic and maintenance strategies. 5
2) Condition Monitoring and Maintenance This is a preventive maintenance approach based on the equipment's tec hnical condition, carried out precisely when needed. It relies on condition monitoring and advanced diagnostic techniques to track the gradual deterioration of equipment over time.  By leveraging highly predictive insights, this method allows for timely scheduling of preventive maintenance activities, which is why it’s also referred to as  ""predictive maintenance. "" At its core, this maintenance strategy integrates comprehensive data from various sources—such as inspections, routine upkeep, operational use, and repair activities—especially insights gained from diagnostics and monitoring. Through rigorous statistical analysis, it accurately assesses the extent of equipment degradation, identifies specific areas where failures may occur (or are likely to occur), and predicts trends in the equipment’s overall technical condition. Armed with this information, operators can then determine the most appropriate type of maintenance intervention. By doing so, organizations gain full control over maintenance activities, ensuring thorough preparation before repairs begin. Moreover, this approach enables seamless coordination with production schedules, maximizing equipment utilization while simultaneously extending the lifespan of critical components. However, this method does come with some drawbacks: it tends to be more expensive and requires sophisticated diagnostic capabilities. Additionally, it demands highly skilled technicians who can interpret complex data and make informed decisions. This approach is particularly well-suited for critical, high-value equipment, key assets on production lines, machinery that cannot be easily disassembled for inspection (such as precision machine tools), and systems whose failure could lead to significant environmental or public health concerns.
① Ensure proper installation to prevent the development of additional stress and vibration. For critical components, avoid dents and scratches, as even the smallest damage could become a potential fracture point. ② Care should be taken to protect the equipment's operating environment, preventing erosion from corrosive media and avoiding excessive temperature differences between its various components. ③ To prevent equipment overload, strictly follow the equipment operating procedures. ④ Take timely corrective measures for parts with cracks.
2) Maintenance Process Stage Once the maintenance process begins, the first step is to disassemble the equipment—following a sequence and approach that reverses the original assembly order, adhering to the principle of ""top-down and outside-in."" This systematic method carefully releases the components from their interlocking and fixed positions within the machine. After removal, each part should undergo a secondary pre-inspection. Based on the findings from this second check, any additional repair parts required will be identified. Furthermore, the availability of replacement and repaired components, along with their current status, will help establish a rough schedule for the maintenance tasks. This ensures that the repair work progresses methodically and according to plan, preventing delays caused by poor coordination in organizational efforts. The precision and performance achievable during equipment maintenance depend on factors such as the technical expertise available for repair work, the number of major overhauls the equipment has undergone, and its pre-repair technical condition. Generally speaking, for machinery undergoing its first major overhaul, both its precision and performance should ideally meet the original factory standards. However, after two or more major overhauls, the equipment’s post-repair precision and performance typically fall short of those of a new unit. That said, if the equipment was in relatively good technical condition prior to the last overhaul, it will likely be easier to restore its quality closer to the original factory standards this time around. Conversely, if the previous overhaul left the equipment in suboptimal condition, it may create significant challenges for the next major repair—and in some cases, the resulting quality might even fail to meet the original factory standards, making further repairs impractical altogether. The assembly of the complete equipment is carried out according to acceptance criteria. During assembly, appropriate reference surfaces should be selected for accurate mechanical and electrical system fault diagnosis and maintenance case studies.
Take machine tools as an example; the process flow for a major overhaul of metal-cutting machine tools is shown in Figure 1.5. Figure 1.5: Major Machine Tool Overhaul Process – Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Electromechanical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance, Page 31 General Technical Requirements for Quality Inspection of Major Machine Tool Repairs Part Processing Quality (1) The processing quality of replaced or repaired workpieces must meet the requirements specified in the drawing. (2) The tooth ends of sliding gears should have chamfers. The portion of the first thread on lead screws, worm gears, and similar components where the end thickness is less than 1 mm must be removed. (3) The scraped surface should not have any traces of machining or noticeable tool marks, and the scraping points must be evenly distributed. When inspected using the coloring method, Within each 25 mm × 25 mm area, the number of contact points must not be less than the values specified in Table 1.1.

For parts under rolling conditions with high contact stresses, methods like chrome plating, spray welding, and overlay welding are ideal due to their ability to withstand such demands. Conversely, sliding conditions with lower contact stresses allow for a broader range of repair technologies.

Context:  
During operation,机电设备 inevitably experience gradual wear, deformation, fracture, corrosion, and other forms of failure in their components. As a result, the equipment's precision, performance, and productivity decline, potentially leading to malfunctions, accidents, or even complete报废 (scrapping). This underscores the critical need for timely maintenance and repairs. In restorative maintenance, all measures are aimed at restoring the equipment as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. Effectively eliminate failures to enhance the equipment's overall utilization rate. Additionally, implementing repair techniques to restore failed components can efficiently achieve this goal. When repairing damage or defects in mechanical parts, several methods and techniques may be available, but determining the best approach depends on considering the following factors. (1) Consider the compatibility of the selected repair technique with the part material. When choosing a repair method, the first step should be to determine whether the technique is suitable for the material of the component being repaired. For instance, manual arc welding is ideal for low-carbon steel, medium-carbon steel, and alloy structural steels—A Case Study Guide for Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Mechanical and Electrical Systems. 38 And stainless steel. Arc surfacing under a flux layer is suitable for low-carbon and medium-carbon steels. Chrome plating technology works well with carbon structural steels, alloy structural steels, stainless steels, and gray cast iron. Bonded repair methods can firmly join parts made of various metallic and non-metallic materials. Spray coating has a broad applicability—almost any type of metal part, including carbon steel, alloy steel, cast iron components, and the vast majority of non-ferrous metal parts, can be coated. However, among metals, only a few non-ferrous materials pose challenges for spraying, such as pure copper; additionally, materials primarily composed of tungsten or molybdenum are also difficult to coat effectively. (2) Consider the patching layer thicknesses that each repair technique can provide. Since the degree of wear varies across different parts, the required thickness of the repair layer to compensate for wear will also differ. Therefore, when selecting a repair technique, it’s important to understand the maximum patching layer thickness achievable by each method.
(3) The mechanical properties of the repair layer—such as its strength and hardness—as well as the bond strength between the repair layer and the component, and the changes in surface strength of the part after repair—are critical indicators for evaluating repair quality and serve as the basis for selecting the appropriate restoration technique. (4) Consider the operating conditions and requirements of the mechanical parts. When selecting a repair technique, the working condition of the part should be taken into account. For example, when mechanical parts operate under rolling conditions, the contact surfaces between the two components experience high contact stresses, making repair techniques like chrome plating, spray welding, and overlay welding particularly suitable. In contrast, when mechanical parts function under sliding conditions—where contact stresses are lower—the range of applicable repair technologies becomes much broader. When selecting a repair technique, it’s important to consider whether the mechanical part can still meet operational requirements after restoration. For instance, if the chosen repair method involves high temperatures during application—such as gas welding or electric welding—it may cause annealing of the mechanical component, compromising the original surface’s heat-treated properties and increasing thermal deformation and residual stresses. Techniques like patch welding or buildup welding, which involve high-temperature processes, are therefore best suited only for non-quenched parts, components that undergo post-weld machining or reshaping, or parts requiring subsequent heat treatment after welding. (5) Consider production feasibility. When selecting repair technologies, it’s essential to take into account the practicality of production, aligning the choice with the existing equipment in the company’s repair workshop, the current level of repair expertise, and the efficiency of the repair production management system. (6) Consider cost-effectiveness. When selecting a repair technique, economic factors should be taken into account. The repair cost of the part and the extended service life after repair should be combined to comprehensively evaluate and measure the economic viability of the chosen repair method. When selecting a parts repair process, it’s essential to consider multiple factors comprehensively rather than focusing on just one aspect. On one hand, you must evaluate the technical requirements of the part being repaired; on the other hand, you should assess the specific characteristics of the repair process itself. Additionally, it’s crucial to align the chosen method with your company’s existing repair capabilities and technical expertise. By doing so, you can ensure the process is both technically sound, economically viable, and practically feasible—ultimately leading to the optimal repair solution."

③ Having well-equipped maintenance facilities organized according to functional divisions and strategically located for optimal efficiency. The main drawback of the planned preventive maintenance system is its poor cost-effectiveness. With fixed maintenance cycles and scopes, it often leads to unnecessary repairs of certain components—what’s known as over-maintenance. During the maintenance process, repairs are categorized into several levels and types based on the depth and breadth of the work required, including major overhauls, mid-level repairs, minor repairs, item-specific repairs, retrofits, and unplanned maintenance tasks—all determined by the scale and nature of the repair workload. (1) Overhaul: A comprehensive or fundamental restoration of the functionality of mechanical and electrical equipment, typically carried out by specialized maintenance teams within factories and mines —or at repair centers established in regions with a high concentration of industrial facilities. During an overhaul, the equipment is either fully or extensively disassembled, with a focus on repairing critical components, replacing or refurbishing parts that have lost their function or are on the verge of doing so. After the repairs, the equipment’s precision is restored to nearly its original factory specifications, while also receiving a fresh cosmetic overhaul to enhance its appearance. (2) Intermediate Overhaul. This is a level of maintenance that falls between major and minor overhauls, serving as a balanced approach to upkeep. (3) Minor Repair. This involves replacing or repairing components that have significantly worn out or are nearing failure within the maintenance interval, without addressing any underlying structural issues. It is a troubleshooting-based repair aimed at restoring functionality. The three levels—major overhaul, mid-term repair, and minor repair—objectively reflect the chronological progression of机电 equipment, making them ideally suited for implementing time-based planned preventive maintenance, a practice widely adopted by most organizations. However, these levels still require complementary repair tiers to address unforeseen maintenance needs effectively. (4) Item-based maintenance. Based on condition monitoring of mechanical and electrical equipment, this involves proactively planning repairs specifically for components or technical items that are about to fail. Item-based maintenance is conducted between major, medium, and minor overhauls—it’s a non-periodic, planned maintenance level that doesn’t follow a fixed cycle. (5) Retrofitting. This involves making localized modifications to existing mechanical and electrical equipment using new technologies, materials, structures, and processes, with the goal of enhancing its precision, functionality, productivity, and reliability. Such repairs are classified as improvement-oriented, and the extent of the work required depends on how well the original equipment’s design accommodates the retrofitting process—as well as on the specific level of performance enhancement desired for the equipment. Retrofitting is also referred to as modernization or upgrading. (6) Unscheduled Maintenance. This is a level of maintenance required for mechanical and electrical equipment due to sudden breakdowns and accidents. The fewer the number and scope of unscheduled maintenance activities, the higher the level of management.
If none of the above standards apply, refer to the equipment manufacturer's technical specifications. (4) Preparation of spare parts, materials, and specialized tools, inspection equipment, and research fixtures. The lead technical personnel should promptly provide the management team with detailed lists of replacement parts, material specifications, as well as lists of specialized tools, inspection equipment, and research fixtures, along with relevant drawings. After verifying the inventory, the management team will place orders or arrange for manufacturing to ensure that these items are available on time for use during major equipment overhauls. (5) Preparing the Overhaul Work Plan. The overhaul work plan is prepared by the planning personnel in the maintenance department, who are responsible for equipment management. Personnel, chief technicians, and maintenance foremen (team leaders) review it together. The overhaul work plan includes: work procedures, the number of workers required for each phase and stage of the job, along with the corresponding duration in days; requirements for seamless coordination between individual work phases; and details on projects that need to be outsourced to external partners, including specific timeframes. A general overhaul work plan can be presented using a ""bar chart"" format, supplemented by necessary explanatory text. For overhauls of complex, high-precision, large-scale, and critical equipment, network scheduling techniques should be employed to ensure efficient resource utilization, shorten project timelines, and enhance overall economic benefits. 4. Material Preparation Before Equipment Maintenance Material preparation before equipment maintenance is a critically important task, serving as the essential logistical foundation for successful repairs. In practice, delays often occur due to insufficient availability of spare parts and components, disrupting the normal flow of maintenance work, prolonging downtime, and ultimately leading to inefficiencies and production losses. Therefore, it is imperative to strengthen material preparation efforts prior to equipment maintenance. After the lead maintenance technician has prepared detailed lists of replacement parts and materials, they should promptly hand these over to the responsible personnel managing spare parts and supplies. Once the inventory has been verified, these managers will place orders accordingly. Meanwhile, after finalizing the repair procedures, the lead maintenance technician must immediately provide the tool management team with detailed lists and drawings of specialized tools, inspection devices, and testing equipment. The tool management staff will then cross-check the existing inventory and forward any necessary items—such as specialized tools, inspection devices, or testing equipment—to the relevant departments for evaluation. Based on the evaluation results, if repairs are indeed required, the departments will arrange for the necessary maintenance activities. Additionally, the tool management team will initiate new procurement requests for any additional specialized tools, inspection devices, or testing equipment that may be needed. 1.4.2 General Process for Mechanical Equipment Maintenance
(3) The mechanical properties of the repair layer—such as its strength and hardness—as well as the bond strength between the repair layer and the component, and the changes in surface strength of the part after repair—are critical indicators for evaluating repair quality and serve as the basis for selecting the appropriate restoration technique. (4) Consider the operating conditions and requirements of the mechanical parts. When selecting a repair technique, the working condition of the part should be taken into account. For example, when mechanical parts operate under rolling conditions, the contact surfaces between the two components experience high contact stresses, making repair techniques like chrome plating, spray welding, and overlay welding particularly suitable. In contrast, when mechanical parts function under sliding conditions—where contact stresses are lower—the range of applicable repair technologies becomes much broader. When selecting a repair technique, it’s important to consider whether the mechanical part can still meet operational requirements after restoration. For instance, if the chosen repair method involves high temperatures during application—such as gas welding or electric welding—it may cause annealing of the mechanical component, compromising the original surface’s heat-treated properties and increasing thermal deformation and residual stresses. Techniques like patch welding or buildup welding, which involve high-temperature processes, are therefore best suited only for non-quenched parts, components that undergo post-weld machining or reshaping, or parts requiring subsequent heat treatment after welding. (5) Consider production feasibility. When selecting repair technologies, it’s essential to take into account the practicality of production, aligning the choice with the existing equipment in the company’s repair workshop, the current level of repair expertise, and the efficiency of the repair production management system. (6) Consider cost-effectiveness. When selecting a repair technique, economic factors should be taken into account. The repair cost of the part and the extended service life after repair should be combined to comprehensively evaluate and measure the economic viability of the chosen repair method. When selecting a parts repair process, it’s essential to consider multiple factors comprehensively rather than focusing on just one aspect. On one hand, you must evaluate the technical requirements of the part being repaired; on the other hand, you should assess the specific characteristics of the repair process itself. Additionally, it’s crucial to align the chosen method with your company’s existing repair capabilities and technical expertise. By doing so, you can ensure the process is both technically sound, economically viable, and practically feasible—ultimately leading to the optimal repair solution. 1.4.6 Methods for Repairing Mechanical Parts 1. Repair Dimension Method For certain mating dimensions, wear and other factors can alter the nature of the fit, leading to component failure. In such cases, cutting processes or other methods can be employed to restore the shape accuracy, positional accuracy, surface roughness, and other technical specifications of the worn areas on the primary part. Meanwhile, the complementary, simpler component—whether a new part manufactured to the correct dimensions while maintaining its original fit characteristics, or a repaired version—is produced accordingly. The dimension obtained after this reconditioning process is referred to as the ""repair size."" This approach is economically advantageous and ensures consistent quality since it involves machining directly on the existing component. However, it does reduce the strength and rigidity of the part, and it also necessitates replacing or repairing the mating component, thereby complicating the interchangeability of parts. The repair dimensioning method is primarily used to restore parts with relatively complex structures, while the corresponding complementary part is typically simpler—such as journal bearings, transmission threads, keyways, or sliding guides. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment 39 2. Inlaying Component Method After localized wear of a part, and provided the structure and strength allow, add a component to compensate for the portion removed due to wear or repair, thereby restoring the original dimensions and precision. 3. Local Repair and Replacement Method The localized repair and replacement method restores a part's functionality by addressing worn or damaged areas through techniques such as local repairs, adjustments, repositioning, or partial replacements. 4. Plastic Deformation Method By leveraging the plastic deformation properties of metallic materials, this method allows excess material from non-functional areas of a part to be redistributed onto worn regions under specific external forces, thereby restoring the part’s original shape and dimensions. This approach not only alters the part’s geometry but also modifies its mechanical properties and microstructure. The primary techniques include upsetting, extrusion, expansion, and thermal straightening. When repairing low-carbon steel or non-ferrous metal parts that have not undergone heat treatment, plastic deformation can be performed without heating. For medium- and high-carbon steel parts or alloy steel parts, heating is required during plastic deformation repair. In the case of quenched parts undergoing plastic deformation repair, they must first be subjected to high-temperature tempering or annealing. 5. Metal Riveting Method This method uses specially designed connectors made from metal materials to mechanically and securely rejoin cracked or broken machine components into a single unit. It is characterized by being operated at room temperature, preventing thermal deformation and avoiding stress concentrations. The equipment is simple, and the process is easy to perform. Primarily, this technique is used to repair cracks or fractures in large castings—but it is not recommended for thin-walled castings smaller than 8 mm in thickness. There are strong-buckle bonding, tight-buckle bonding, premium-buckle bonding, and thermal-buckle bonding methods. For the specific processes of each bonding method, please refer to the relevant references. 6. Weld Repair Method The process of welding—where two or more materials (either identical or different) are joined permanently by heating, applying pressure, or combining both methods to achieve atomic-level bonding—is known as welding. At its core, this technique involves repairing damaged parts such as those with cracks or fractures, as well as building up wear-resistant and corrosion-resistant weld layers onto the surfaces of failed components. Its primary purpose is to restore most metal parts that have suffered damage due to wear, breakage, cracking, pitting, or other forms of deterioration. The advantages of the welding repair method include high bonding strength, simple welding equipment, mature technology, no limitations on part size, low cost, high efficiency, and great flexibility. The downside is that, due to the high welding temperature, it can easily cause changes in the microstructure, leading to stress and deformation. Additionally, it’s not suitable for repairing parts that require high precision, are slender, or relatively thin, as these components are prone to defects such as porosity, slag inclusion, and cracking. Welding techniques are primarily applied to metallic base materials, with commonly used methods including arc welding, argon arc welding, CO2 shielded welding, oxy-acetylene welding, laser welding, and more. Non-metallic materials like plastics can also be welded using specialized techniques. Future welding processes will focus on developing new welding methods, equipment, and materials to further enhance welding quality, safety, and reliability. This includes improving existing welding energy sources such as arc, plasma arc, electron beam, and laser technologies. Additionally, advancements in electronics and control technologies will be leveraged to optimize the process performance of arcs, while also enabling the development of reliable, lightweight arc-tracking systems. On the other hand, efforts will be made to elevate the level of welding mechanization and automation. For instance, welders will increasingly feature program-controlled or digitally controlled systems. Specialized automated welding machines capable of handling the entire process—from preparation and welding to quality monitoring—will be developed. Moreover, on automated welding production lines, numerically controlled welding manipulators and robots will be widely adopted and scaled up, boosting overall welding productivity while significantly improving workplace hygiene and safety conditions.

Context:  
Shielded Metal Arc Welding Shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), also known as manual arc welding, is an arc welding process in which a welder manually controls the electrode while using the electric arc generated between the electrode and the workpiece to locally heat and melt both the electrode and the base material for joining. It remains the most widely used welding method today. The advantages of this method include: simple equipment that’s easy to maintain, flexible operation, and the ability to weld seams in any spatial position—essentially anywhere the electrode can reach—making it highly versatile across a wide range of applications. The drawbacks are: high requirements for welders, poor working conditions, and low production efficiency. The equipment used in shielded metal arc welding is an arc welder, which has a simple structure and mainly consists of two parts: the arc welding power source and the welding clamp. Welding electrode arc welding equipment should be used with the following precautions. (1) Check that the wiring is correct and ensure the equipment casing is properly grounded. If a welder experiences electric shock, first disconnect the power supply before administering first aid. (2) When operating the power switch, always wear dry gloves and avoid standing directly in front of it to prevent facial burns caused by arc sparks. (3) Welding cables must not be placed near the welding machine or on hot metal welds, and they should also be protected from collisions and abrasion.
(4) When stopping work, disconnect the power promptly, and ensure equipment is properly covered when working outdoors. This method can weld a variety of metal materials and accommodate different structural shapes, enabling welding in virtually any position with convenient operation. When selecting welding electrodes, it’s essential to consider the material properties of the workpiece, the working conditions, and the specific structural features. The diameter of the electrode typically varies depending on the thickness of the weldment, as there is a direct relationship between welding current and electrode diameter. During welding, the thickness of each weld pass should generally not exceed 5 mm; however, for thicker workpieces, multi-pass welding may be recommended. 3) Surfacing Welding Using welding techniques, a layer or several layers of material with desired properties are deposited onto the part. This process can restore the part's dimensions and even enhance its performance by improving the surface characteristics of the component. Compared to the entire machine part, the weld overlay is typically very thin, with the primary requirement being high surface wear resistance. Notably, the weld overlay material often differs from the base material, which can lead to challenges in weldability due to these material property differences. Handheld arc surfacing equipment is simple, flexible, and cost-effective, making it particularly suitable for irregularly shaped parts and components that are difficult to access. However, it has low productivity and can be challenging to achieve thin, uniform surfacing layers.

Gas welding A welding method that uses the flame generated by the combustion of a flammable gas mixed with an oxidizing gas as a heat source, melting both the workpiece and the filler material to achieve atomic-level bonding. The primary oxidizing gas is oxygen, while common flammable gases include acetylene, liquefied petroleum gas, and others. Oxygen-acetylene gas welding equipment primarily includes oxygen cylinders, acetylene cylinders (if acetylene is used as the combustible gas), pressure regulators, welding torches, and hoses. Since the gas cylinders used to store these flammable and explosive gases are pressure vessels, this method is one of the most hazardous among all welding techniques. Advantages of gas welding: simple equipment, flexible use; excellent adaptability for welding cast iron and certain non-ferrous metals; and a valuable option when welding is needed in areas with insufficient power supply. Drawbacks of gas welding: lower production efficiency; significant workpiece deformation and a larger heat-affected zone after welding; and greater difficulty in achieving automation. The flame temperature typically ranges from 2,700 to 3,300°C, making it suitable for welding various materials. It is virtually compatible with almost all metallic materials, particularly well-suited for thin sections less than 6 mm thick. Additionally, it excels in welding aluminum, aluminum alloys, copper, and copper alloys. The thickness can be thicker.
(2) The process is  flexible, requires few operational steps, allows for quick repairs, and reduces machining time. (3) Highly adaptable, generally unrestricted by workpiece size or site conditions. ( 4) Coating thickness can be controlled. (5) Apart from spray welding, the base material is heated to a lower temperature, resulting in minimal workpiece deformation and only slight  changes in microstructure and mechanical properties. (6) Components made from various substrate materials can be used to prepare a wide range of protective and functional coatings  on nearly all solid material surfaces. However, it’s important to remember that spray painting is an extremely hazardous task. Operators must always keep the following warnings in  mind: High-speed, high-temperature spray jets can cause injury to both people and equipment; spray dust is harmful to health—so ensure proper dust control and adequate ventilation ; loud spray noise may damage hearing—always wear ear protection; and radiation from the spray arc can harm your eyesight—make sure to wear safety goggles. Spray Welding Repair Technology If the thermal spray coating is further heated until both the coating and the substrate surface reach a molten state, allowing them to fuse together through metallurgical bonding and forming a robust working layer, this technique is known as spray welding repair technology. The materials used in spray welding can include various metals, alloys, or even non-metals, while the substrate material itself can also be made from a wide range of metals, alloys, or non-metals. The thickness of the spray-welded coating typically ranges from 0.5 mm to several millimeters, and the resulting coating structure is porous, which helps retain oil, leading to excellent lubrication and wear resistance. The spray welding process itself is straightforward. Single, short repair cycles, high productivity, and low costs. The spray welding repair technique can effectively enhance and improve the performance of part surfaces, such as oxidation resistance, electrical conductivity, insulation properties, and thermal insulation. However, the bond strength of the sprayed coating is relatively low, so caution should be exercised during application. Spray welding repair can restore the dimensions of worn components, such as machine tool spindles, crankshafts, camshaft journals, motor rotor shafts, machine tool guides, and slides. It can also be used to repair defects in castings, like sand holes and porosity. Additionally, applying a wear-resistant material—such as phosphor bronze or aluminum bronze—to areas requiring enhanced durability can significantly improve the component's resistance to wear. Meanwhile, spraying protective coatings onto specific areas can boost the part's corrosion resistance and other performance characteristics. Bonding and Coating Repair Techniques The method of joining parts made of the same or different materials into a single unit using adhesives, or of repairing worn or damaged compon ents, is known as bonding and repair bonding. Bonding can be used to fix broken parts, replacing screw connections when installing guide rail plates. It can also involve applying a dhesive to the worn areas of components—such as shafts or holes—followed by machining to restore their dimensions and geometric accuracy. Additionally, adhesives are employed to se al the mating surfaces between housings and lids, as well as pipe joints, ensuring both a tight seal and secure locking of threaded connections. Furthermore, adhesives can fill def ects like sand holes, air pockets, and porosity in castings, effectively preventing leaks and other issues. The bonding process has several advantages: First, it offers strong adhe sive strength and can bond a wide range of materials—everything from various metals to non-metallic substances. First, it provides strong adhesion and can bond dissimilar materials  together. Second, the process operates at relatively low temperatures, preventing thermal deformation of the bonded materials. Third, after bonding, the integrity and surface fini sh of the original components remain intact, with no stress concentrations formed. Additionally, the adhesive joint exhibits excellent chemical stability, insulation properties, an d sealing performance. Finally, the bonding process is simple, cost-effective, and allows for quick repair times. The drawback of the bonding process is that it lacks high-temperat ure resistance—organic adhesives typically can only withstand long-term operation up to 150°C. Inorganic adhesives can withstand high temperatures of up to 700°C; however, they exh ibit poor impact resistance and aging performance. Compared to welding, their bonding strength is relatively low. Nowadays, plastic components are increasingly used in engineering  applications. Plastics are broadly categorized into two types: thermoplastics and thermosets. For bonding thermoplastic parts, both hot-melt adhesive bonding and solvent-based adhe sive bonding methods can be employed. The specific procedures are outlined below. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment 43 (1) Hot-melt bonding method. The surfaces to be bonded are heated and melted using electric heat, hot air, or frictional heat, then pressed together under sufficient pressure u ntil they cool and solidify. For most thermoplastic materials, heating the surface to 150–230°C is sufficient for bonding. (2) Solvent bonding method. Apply the appropriate solvent  to the bonding area, allow it to soften the plastic, and then bring the surfaces together while applying pressure. Force ensures strong adhesion once the solvent has evaporated, s uch as when polyethylene dissolves in xylene. If the solvent is chosen appropriately, the results are even better—however, thermosetting plastics remain insoluble in the solvent. Surface Enhancement Technologies Surface enhancement technology refers to a process that modifies the microstructure and properties of a part's surface, making them distinct from those of the base material. This technique can significantly improve the surface’s hardness, strength, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance. Specifically, it includes several methods such as surface mechanical strengthening, surface heat treatment strengthening, chemical heat treatment strengthening, laser surface treatment, and electrical discharge machining-based surface enhancement. Surface Mechanical Strengthening Surface mechanical strengthening involves inducing compressive deformation in the metal surface of a part through methods such as shot peening, roll forming, and internal extrusion, creating a hardened layer measuring 0.3 to 1.5 mm in thickness on the surface. Shot peening involves blasting high-velocity projectiles onto a component's surface, inducing intense plastic deformation in the metal material and creating a cold-worked layer with elevated residual stresses—known as the shot-peened layer. Shot peening enhances a material's resistance to fatigue fracture, preventing fatigue failure, plastic deformation, and brittle fracture while extending its fatigue life. It is suitable for use in a wide range of industries, including machinery, aerospace, marine applications, petroleum, mining, railways, transportation, heavy machinery, and military equipment. Rolling enhancement involves using a diamond or other type of rolling head to apply a specific rolling force onto the surface of a part. A method that induces hardening of the rolled surface through strain-induced strengthening, thereby enhancing the mechanical properties of the component's surface. Surface Heat Treatment Strengthening and Chemical Heat Treatment Strengthening (1) Surface heat treatment strengthening. Surface heat treatment is a metal heat treatment process that involves heating only the surface layer of a workpiece to alter its mechanical properties. To heat only the surface of the workpiece without allowing excessive heat to penetrate into its interior, the heat source used must have a high energy density—meaning it delivers significant thermal energy over a small area of the workpiece, enabling the surface or specific regions to reach extremely high temperatures in a short or even instantaneous time. The main methods of surface heat treatment include flame quenching and induction heating, while common heat sources include flames such as oxy-acetylene or oxy-propane, as well as induced currents, lasers, and electron beams. (2) Surface chemical heat treatment strengthening. Surface chemical heat treatment is a metal heat treatment process that alters the chemical composition, microstructure, and properties of a workpiece's surface layer. Unlike surface heat treatment, which primarily modifies the material's surface properties through temperature changes, surface chemical heat treatment specifically targets the chemical composition of the surface layer. Chemical heat treatment involves heating a workpiece in a medium containing carbon, nitrogen, or other alloying elements—such as gas, liquid, or solid—and holding it at that temperature for an extended period. This process allows elements like carbon, nitrogen, boron, and chromium to diffuse into the surface of the workpiece. After diffusion, additional heat treatment processes, such as quenching and tempering, may be carried out as needed. The main methods of chemical heat treatment include carburizing, nitriding, and metal impregnation. 3) Laser Surface Treatment Heating is achieved using a laser beam, which rapidly melts a thin layer of the workpiece surface to a specific depth. Simultaneously, alloy elements are applied to the workpiece surface via methods such as vacuum evaporation, electroplating, or ion implantation. Under laser irradiation, these elements fully fuse with the base metal, and after solidification, a specially engineered alloy layer—ranging from 10 to 1,000 micrometers thick—is formed on the mold surface, exhibiting unique properties. The cooling rate during this process is equivalent to… Quenching with Rapid Cooling: A Case Study Tutorial on Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Mechatronic Systems
(3) The mechanical properties of the repair layer—such as its strength and hardness—as well  as the bond strength between the repair layer and the component, and the changes in surface strength of the part after repair—are critical indicators for evaluating repair quality  and serve as the basis for selecting the appropriate restoration technique. (4) Consider the operating conditions and requirements of the mechanical parts. When selecting a repair  technique, the working condition of the part should be taken into account. For example, For example, when mechanical parts operate under rolling conditions, the contact surfaces between the two components experience high contact stresses, making repair techniques like chrome plating, spray welding, and overlay welding particularly suitable. In contrast, when mechanical parts function under sliding conditions—where contact stresses are lower—the range of applicable repair technologies becomes much broader. When selecting a repair technique, it’s important to consider whether the mechanical part can still meet operational requirements after restoration. For instance, if the chosen repair method involves high temperatures during application—such as gas welding or electric welding—it may cause annealing of the mechanical component, compromising the original surface’s heat-treated properties and increasing thermal deformation and residual stresses. Techniques like patch welding or buildup welding, which involve high-temperature processes, are therefore best suited only for non-quenched parts, components that undergo post-weld machining or reshaping, or parts requiring subsequent heat treatment after welding. (5) Consider production feasibility. When selecting repair technologies, it’s essential to take into account the practicality of production, aligning the choice with the existing equipment in the company’s repair workshop, the current level of repair expertise, and the efficiency of the repair production management system. (6) Consider cost-effectiveness. When selecting a repair technique, economic factors should be taken into account. The repair cost of the part and the extended service life after repair should be combined to comprehensively evaluate and measure the economic viability of the chosen repair method. When selecting a parts repair process, it’s essential to consider multiple factors comprehensively rather than focusing on just one aspect. On one hand, you must evaluate the technical requirements of the part being repaired; on the other hand, you should assess the specific characteristics of the repair process itself. Additionally, it’s crucial to align the chosen method with your company’s existing repair capabilities and technical expertise. By doing so, you can ensure the process is both technically sound, economically viable, and practically feasible—ultimately leading to the optimal repair solution. 1.4.6 Methods for Repairing Mechanical Parts 1. Repair Dimension Method For certain mating dimensions, wear and other factors can alter the nature of the fit, leading to component failure. In such cases, cutting processes or other methods can be employed to restore the shape accuracy, positional accuracy, surface roughness, and other technical specifications of the worn areas on the primary part. Meanwhile, the complementary, simpler component—whether a new part manufactured to the correct dimensions while maintaining its original fit characteristics, or a repaired version—is produced accordingly. The dimension obtained after this reconditioning process is referred to as the ""repair size."" This approach is economically advantageous and ensures consistent quality since it involves machining directly on the existing component. However, it does reduce the strength and rigidity of the part, and it also necessitates replacing or repairing the mating component, thereby complicating the interchangeability of parts. The repair dimensioning method is primarily used to restore parts with relatively complex structures, while the corresponding complementary part is typically simpler—such as journal bearings, transmission threads, keyways, or sliding guides.

The primary techniques include upsetting, extrusion, expansion, and thermal straightening.

For medium- and high-carbon steel parts or alloy steel parts, heating is required during plastic deformation repair. In the case of quenched parts undergoing plastic deformation repair, they must first be subjected to high-temperature tempering or annealing. 5.

1.4 Mechanical Equipment Maintenance Procedures and Implementation With the continuous advancement of new materials, processes, and technologies, repairing mechanical parts has evolved beyond simply restoring them to their original condition. Many advanced techniques now not only revive components but also enhance their performance and extend their service life. For instance, methods such as electroplating, surfacing welding, application of wear-resistant coatings, thermal spraying and flame spraying, adhesive bonding, and various surface-hardening treatments allow for the precise deposition of small amounts of high-performance materials onto part surfaces—at relatively low costs—while significantly boosting wear resistance. As a result, in the maintenance of electromechanical equipment, fully leveraging these repair techniques and carefully selecting appropriate processes can reduce downtime, cut maintenance expenses, and ultimately lead to substantial improvements in a company’s economic efficiency.

(6) Components made from various substrate materials can be used to prepare a wide range of protective and functional coatings  on nearly all solid material surfaces. However, it’s important to remember that spray painting is an extremely hazardous task. Operators must always keep the following warnings in  mind: High-speed, high-temperature spray jets can cause injury to both people and equipment; spray dust is harmful to health—so ensure proper dust control and adequate ventilation ; loud spray noise may damage hearing—always wear ear protection; and radiation from the spray arc can harm your eyesight—make sure to wear safety goggles. Spray Welding Repair Technology If the thermal spray coating is further heated until both the coating and the substrate surface reach a molten state, allowing them to fuse together through metallurgical bonding and forming a robust working layer, this technique is known as spray welding repair technology. The materials used in spray welding can include various metals, alloys, or even non-metals, while the substrate material itself can also be made from a wide range of metals, alloys, or non-metals. The thickness of the spray-welded coating typically ranges from 0.5 mm to several millimeters, and the resulting coating structure is porous, which helps retain oil, leading to excellent lubrication and wear resistance. The spray welding process itself is straightforward. Single, short repair cycles, high productivity, and low costs. The spray welding repair technique can effectively enhance and improve the performance of part surfaces, such as oxidation resistance, electrical conductivity, insulation properties, and thermal insulation. However, the bond strength of the sprayed coating is relatively low, so caution should be exercised during application. Spray welding repair can restore the dimensions of worn components, such as machine tool spindles, crankshafts, camshaft journals, motor rotor shafts, machine tool guides, and slides. It can also be used to repair defects in castings, like sand holes and porosity. Additionally, applying a wear-resistant material—such as phosphor bronze or aluminum bronze—to areas requiring enhanced durability can significantly improve the component's resistance to wear. Meanwhile, spraying protective coatings onto specific areas can boost the part's corrosion resistance and other performance characteristics. Bonding and Coating Repair Techniques The method of joining parts made of the same or different materials into a single unit using adhesives, or of repairing worn or damaged compon ents, is known as bonding and repair bonding. Bonding can be used to fix broken parts, replacing screw connections when installing guide rail plates. It can also involve applying a dhesive to the worn areas of components—such as shafts or holes—followed by machining to restore their dimensions and geometric accuracy. Additionally, adhesives are employed to se al the mating surfaces between housings and lids, as well as pipe joints, ensuring both a tight seal and secure locking of threaded connections. Furthermore, adhesives can fill def ects like sand holes, air pockets, and porosity in castings, effectively preventing leaks and other issues. The bonding process has several advantages: First, it offers strong adhe sive strength and can bond a wide range of materials—everything from various metals to non-metallic substances. First, it provides strong adhesion and can bond dissimilar materials  together. Second, the process operates at relatively low temperatures, preventing thermal deformation of the bonded materials. Third, after bonding, the integrity and surface fini sh of the original components remain intact, with no stress concentrations formed. Additionally, the adhesive joint exhibits excellent chemical stability, insulation properties, an d sealing performance. Finally, the bonding process is simple, cost-effective, and allows for quick repair times. The drawback of the bonding process is that it lacks high-temperat ure resistance—organic adhesives typically can only withstand long-term operation up to 150°C. Inorganic adhesives can withstand high temperatures of up to 700°C; however, they exh ibit poor impact resistance and aging performance. Compared to welding, their bonding strength is relatively low. Nowadays, plastic components are increasingly used in engineering  applications. Plastics are broadly categorized into two types: thermoplastics and thermosets. For bonding thermoplastic parts, both hot-melt adhesive bonding and solvent-based adhe sive bonding methods can be employed. The specific procedures are outlined below. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment 43 (1) Hot-melt bonding method. The surfaces to be bonded are heated and melted using electric heat, hot air, or frictional heat, then pressed together under sufficient pressure u ntil they cool and solidify. For most thermoplastic materials, heating the surface to 150–230°C is sufficient for bonding. (2) Solvent bonding method. Apply the appropriate solvent  to the bonding area, allow it to soften the plastic, and then bring the surfaces together while applying pressure. Force ensures strong adhesion once the solvent has evaporated, s uch as when polyethylene dissolves in xylene. If the solvent is chosen appropriately, the results are even better—however, thermosetting plastics remain insoluble in the solvent. Surface Enhancement Technologies Surface enhancement technology refers to a process that modifies the microstructure and properties of a part's surface, making them distinct from those of the base material. This technique can significantly improve the surface’s hardness, strength, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance. Specifically, it includes several methods such as surface mechanical strengthening, surface heat treatment strengthening, chemical heat treatment strengthening, laser surface treatment, and electrical discharge machining-based surface enhancement. Surface Mechanical Strengthening Surface mechanical strengthening involves inducing compressive deformation in the metal surface of a part through methods such as shot peening, roll forming, and internal extrusion, creating a hardened layer measuring 0.3 to 1.5 mm in thickness on the surface. Shot peening involves blasting high-velocity projectiles onto a component's surface, inducing intense plastic deformation in the metal material and creating a cold-worked layer with elevated residual stresses—known as the shot-peened layer. Shot peening enhances a material's resistance to fatigue fracture, preventing fatigue failure, plastic deformation, and brittle fracture while extending its fatigue life. It is suitable for use in a wide range of industries, including machinery, aerospace, marine applications, petroleum, mining, railways, transportation, heavy machinery, and military equipment. Rolling enhancement involves using a diamond or other type of rolling head to apply a specific rolling force onto the surface of a part. A method that induces hardening of the rolled surface through strain-induced strengthening, thereby enhancing the mechanical properties of the component's surface. Surface Heat Treatment Strengthening and Chemical Heat Treatment Strengthening (1) Surface heat treatment strengthening. Surface heat treatment is a metal heat treatment process that involves heating only the surface layer of a workpiece to alter its mechanical properties. To heat only the surface of the workpiece without allowing excessive heat to penetrate into its interior, the heat source used must have a high energy density—meaning it delivers significant thermal energy over a small area of the workpiece, enabling the surface or specific regions to reach extremely high temperatures in a short or even instantaneous time. The main methods of surface heat treatment include flame quenching and induction heating, while common heat sources include flames such as oxy-acetylene or oxy-propane, as well as induced currents, lasers, and electron beams. (2) Surface chemical heat treatment strengthening. Surface chemical heat treatment is a metal heat treatment process that alters the chemical composition, microstructure, and properties of a workpiece's surface layer. Unlike surface heat treatment, which primarily modifies the material's surface properties through temperature changes, surface chemical heat treatment specifically targets the chemical composition of the surface layer. Chemical heat treatment involves heating a workpiece in a medium containing carbon, nitrogen, or other alloying elements—such as gas, liquid, or solid—and holding it at that temperature for an extended period. This process allows elements like carbon, nitrogen, boron, and chromium to diffuse into the surface of the workpiece. After diffusion, additional heat treatment processes, such as quenching and tempering, may be carried out as needed. The main methods of chemical heat treatment include carburizing, nitriding, and metal impregnation. 3) Laser Surface Treatment Heating is achieved using a laser beam, which rapidly melts a thin layer of the workpiece surface to a specific depth. Simultaneously, alloy elements are applied to the workpiece surface via methods such as vacuum evaporation, electroplating, or ion implantation. Under laser irradiation, these elements fully fuse with the base metal, and after solidification, a specially engineered alloy layer—ranging from 10 to 1,000 micrometers thick—is formed on the mold surface, exhibiting unique properties. The cooling rate during this process is equivalent to… Quenching with Rapid Cooling: A Case Study Tutorial on Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Mechatronic Systems
Shielded Metal Arc Welding Shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), also known as manual arc welding, is an arc welding process in which a welder manually controls the electrode while using the electric arc generated between the electrode and the workpiece to locally heat and melt both the electrode and the base material for joining. It remains the most widely used welding method today. The advantages of this method include: simple equipment that’s easy to maintain, flexible operation, and the ability to weld seams in any spatial position—essentially anywhere the electrode can reach—making it highly versatile across a wide range of applications. The drawbacks are: high requirements for welders, poor working conditions, and low production efficiency. The equipment used in shielded metal arc welding is an arc welder, which has a simple structure and mainly consists of two parts: the arc welding power source and the welding clamp. Welding electrode arc welding equipment should be used with the following precautions. (1) Check that the wiring is correct and ensure the equipment casing is properly grounded. If a welder experiences electric shock, first disconnect the power supply before administering first aid. (2) When operating the power switch, always wear dry gloves and avoid standing directly in front of it to prevent facial burns caused by arc sparks. (3) Welding cables must not be placed near the welding machine or on hot metal welds, and they should also be protected from collisions and abrasion.
Gas welding A welding method that uses the flame generated by the combustion of a flammable gas mixed with an oxidizing gas as a heat source, melting both the workpiece and the filler material to achieve atomic-level bonding. The primary oxidizing gas is oxygen, while common flammable gases include acetylene, liquefied petroleum gas, and others. Oxygen-acetylene gas welding equipment primarily includes oxygen cylinders, acetylene cylinders (if acetylene is used as the combustible gas), pressure regulators, welding torches, and hoses. Since the gas cylinders used to store these flammable and explosive gases are pressure vessels, this method is one of the most hazardous among all welding techniques. Advantages of gas welding: simple equipment, flexible use; excellent adaptability for welding cast iron and certain non-ferrous metals; and a valuable option when welding is needed in areas with insufficient power supply. Drawbacks of gas welding: lower production efficiency; significant workpiece deformation and a larger heat-affected zone after welding; and greater difficulty in achieving automation. The flame temperature typically ranges from 2,700 to 3,300°C, making it suitable for welding various materials. It is virtually compatible with almost all metallic materials, particularly well-suited for thin sections less than 6 mm thick. Additionally, it excels in welding aluminum, aluminum alloys, copper, and copper alloys. The thickness can be thicker."

Context:  
Use a metal material with a melting point lower than that of the base material as the brazing filler metal, and heat the workpieces—where the filler metal has been placed—to a temperature above the filler metal's melting point but below the base material's melting point. The method of joining components by using a liquid brazing filler metal that wets the base material at its melting point, fills the joint gap, and then diffuses into the base material to form a strong bond is called brazing. Brazing is divided into hard brazing and soft brazing. Brazing performed using filler metals with melting points above 450°C is commonly referred to as hard brazing, examples include copper brazing and silver brazing; while brazing conducted with filler metals having melting points below 450°C is typically called soft brazing, such as tin soldering and lead soldering. Brazing has the following characteristics: ① It requires lower heating temperatures, resulting in minimal changes to the microstructure and mechanical properties of the workpiece. ② The molten braze filler metal fills the gaps between the metals being joined via capillary action, leading to excellent gas-tightness in the weld. ③ The workpiece experiences little deformation, producing smooth and even joints. ④ Can join dissimilar materials. ⑤ Low weld strength. Brazing methods can technically be divided into two types: soldering iron brazing and flame brazing. (1) Soldering with a soldering iron. The solder and the area to be welded are heated using an electric soldering iron, making it suitable for soft soldering applications where temperatures remain below 300°C—such as with tin-lead or lead-based solders. When soldering thin or small components, a flux is typically required. The power rating of the soldering iron should be selected based on the type of solder, the material of the workpiece, and the shape and size of the component. (2) Flame brazing. This method uses a flame to heat the braze alloy and the area to be joined, making it suitable for hard brazing applications where temperatures exceed 300°C. It is particularly ideal for workpieces whose shape, size, or equipment constraints make other brazing methods impractical. Commonly used brazing alloys include copper-zinc, copper-phosphorus, silver-based, aluminum-based, and zinc-aluminum alloys, enabling the joining of materials such as steel, stainless steel, cemented carbides, cast iron, copper, silver, aluminum, and their respective alloys. Since brazed joints typically exhibit lower strength compared to other welding techniques, brazing is generally recommended for repairing cracks and fractures in components that do not require high structural integrity. Additionally, designing and selecting an appropriate joint configuration is crucial to enhance the overall strength of the assembly. Brazing is especially well-suited for addressing localized defects—such as abrasions or scratches—on low-speed moving parts."

3) Perform surface treatment By employing various surface treatment methods—such as surface heat treatment (e.g., surface hardening of steel), surface chemical heat treatments (e.g., carburizing and nitriding of steel), thermal spraying, flame spraying, coatings, deposition, ion implantation, roll forming, and shot peening—surface wear resistance can be significantly improved. This is one of the most effective and cost-efficient approaches available. 4) Rational structural design Proper and rational structural design is an effective way to reduce wear and enhance wear resistance. The structure should facilitate the formation and restoration of protective surface films between friction pairs, ensure uniform pressure distribution, promote efficient dissipation of frictional heat, enable smooth removal of wear debris, and prevent the ingress of external abrasive particles and dust. In structural design, the principle of substitution can be applied—allowing one component in the system to wear while protecting another critical part—or the principle of transfer, where one member of the friction pair is intentionally worn more rapidly to safeguard the other. More valuable parts.
1.4 Mechanical Equipment Maintenance Procedures and Implementation With the continuous advancement of new materials, processes, and technologies, repairing mechanical parts has evolved beyond simply restoring them to their original condition. Many advanced techniques now not only revive components but also enhance their performance and extend their service life. For instance, methods such as electroplating, surfacing welding, application of wear-resistant coatings, thermal spraying and flame spraying, adhesive bonding, and various surface-hardening treatments allow for the precise deposition of small amounts of high-performance materials onto part surfaces—at relatively low costs—while significantly boosting wear resistance. As a result, in the maintenance of electromechanical equipment, fully leveraging these repair techniques and carefully selecting appropriate processes can reduce downtime, cut maintenance expenses, and ultimately lead to substantial improvements in a company’s economic efficiency. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Repair for Electromechanical Equipment 27
If none of the above standards apply, refer to the equipment manufacturer's technical specifications. (4) Preparation of spare parts, materials, and specialized tools, inspection equipment, and research fixtures. The lead technical personnel should promptly provide the management team with detailed lists of replacement parts, material specifications, as well as lists of specialized tools, inspection equipment, and research fixtures, along with relevant drawings. After verifying the inventory, the management team will place orders or arrange for manufacturing to ensure that these items are available on time for use during major equipment overhauls. (5) Preparing the Overhaul Work Plan. The overhaul work plan is prepared by the planning personnel in the maintenance department, who are responsible for equipment management. Personnel, chief technicians, and maintenance foremen (team leaders) review it together. The overhaul work plan includes: work procedures, the number of workers required for each phase and stage of the job, along with the corresponding duration in days; requirements for seamless coordination between individual work phases; and details on projects that need to be outsourced to external partners, including specific timeframes. A general overhaul work plan can be presented using a ""bar chart"" format, supplemented by necessary explanatory text. For overhauls of complex, high-precision, large-scale, and critical equipment, network scheduling techniques should be employed to ensure efficient resource utilization, shorten project timelines, and enhance overall economic benefits. 4. Material Preparation Before Equipment Maintenance Material preparation before equipment maintenance is a critically important task, serving as the essential logistical foundation for successful repairs. In practice, delays often occur due to insufficient availability of spare parts and components, disrupting the normal flow of maintenance work, prolonging downtime, and ultimately leading to inefficiencies and production losses. Therefore, it is imperative to strengthen material preparation efforts prior to equipment maintenance. After the lead maintenance technician has prepared detailed lists of replacement parts and materials, they should promptly hand these over to the responsible personnel managing spare parts and supplies. Once the inventory has been verified, these managers will place orders accordingly. Meanwhile, after finalizing the repair procedures, the lead maintenance technician must immediately provide the tool management team with detailed lists and drawings of specialized tools, inspection devices, and testing equipment. The tool management staff will then cross-check the existing inventory and forward any necessary items—such as specialized tools, inspection devices, or testing equipment—to the relevant departments for evaluation. Based on the evaluation results, if repairs are indeed required, the departments will arrange for the necessary maintenance activities. Additionally, the tool management team will initiate new procurement requests for any additional specialized tools, inspection devices, or testing equipment that may be needed. 1.4.2 General Process for Mechanical Equipment Maintenance

Spray Welding Repair Technology If the thermal spray coating is further heated until both the coating and the substrate surface reach a molten state, allowing them to fuse together through metallurgical bonding and forming a robust working layer, this technique is known as spray welding repair technology. The materials used in spray welding can include various metals, alloys, or even non-metals, while the substrate material itself can also be made from a wide range of metals, alloys, or non-metals. The thickness of the spray-welded coating typically ranges from 0.5 mm to several millimeters, and the resulting coating structure is porous, which helps retain oil, leading to excellent lubrication and wear resistance. The spray welding process itself is straightforward. Single, short repair cycles, high productivity, and low costs. The spray welding repair technique can effectively enhance and improve the performance of part surfaces, such as oxidation resistance, electrical conductivity, insulation properties, and thermal insulation. However, the bond strength of the sprayed coating is relatively low, so caution should be exercised during application. Spray welding repair can restore the dimensions of worn components, such as machine tool spindles, crankshafts, camshaft journals, motor rotor shafts, machine tool guides, and slides. It can also be used to repair defects in castings, like sand holes and porosity. Additionally, applying a wear-resistant material—such as phosphor bronze or aluminum bronze—to areas requiring enhanced durability can significantly improve the component's resistance to wear. Meanwhile, spraying protective coatings onto specific areas can boost the part's corrosion resistance and other performance characteristics. Bonding and Coating Repair Techniques The method of joining parts made of the same or different materials into a single unit using adhesives, or of repairing worn or damaged components, is known as bonding and repair bonding. Bonding can be used to fix broken parts, replacing screw connections when installing guide rail plates. It can also involve applying adhesive to the worn areas of components—such as shafts or holes—followed by machining to restore their dimensions and geometric accuracy. Additionally, adhesives are employed to seal the mating surfaces between housings and lids, as well as pipe joints, ensuring both a tight seal and secure locking of threaded connections. Furthermore, adhesives can fill defects like sand holes, air pockets, and porosity in castings, effectively preventing leaks and other issues. The bonding process has several advantages: First, it offers strong adhesive strength and can bond a wide range of materials—everything from various metals to non-metallic substances. First, it provides strong adhesion and can bond dissimilar materials together. Second, the process operates at relatively low temperatures, preventing thermal deformation of the bonded materials. Third, after bonding, the integrity and surface finish of the original components remain intact, with no stress concentrations formed. Additionally, the adhesive joint exhibits excellent chemical stability, insulation properties, and sealing performance. Finally, the bonding process is simple, cost-effective, and allows for quick repair times. The drawback of the bonding process is that it lacks high-temperature resistance—organic adhesives typically can only withstand long-term operation up to 150°C. Inorganic adhesives can withstand high temperatures of up to 700°C; however, they exhibit poor impact resistance and aging performance. Compared to welding, their bonding strength is relatively low. Nowadays, plastic components are increasingly used in engineering applications. Plastics are broadly categorized into two types: thermoplastics and thermosets. For bonding thermoplastic parts, both hot-melt adhesive bonding and solvent-based adhesive bonding methods can be employed. The specific procedures are outlined below. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment 43 (1) Hot-melt bonding method. The surfaces to be bonded are heated and melted using electric heat, hot air, or frictional heat, then pressed together under sufficient pressure until they cool and solidify. For most thermoplastic materials, heating the surface to 150–230°C is sufficient for bonding. (2) Solvent bonding method. Apply the appropriate solvent to the bonding area, allow it to soften the plastic, and then bring the surfaces together while applying pressure. Force ensures strong adhesion once the solvent has evaporated, such as when polyethylene dissolves in xylene. If the solvent is chosen appropriately, the results are even better—however, thermosetting plastics remain insoluble in the solvent. Surface Enhancement Technologies Surface enhancement technology refers to a process that modifies the microstructure and properties of a part's surface, making them distinct from those of the base material. This technique can significantly improve the surface’s hardness, strength, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance. Specifically, it includes several methods such as surface mechanical strengthening, surface heat treatment strengthening, chemical heat treatment strengthening, laser surface treatment, and electrical discharge machining-based surface enhancement. Surface Mechanical Strengthening Surface mechanical strengthening involves inducing compressive deformation in the metal surface of a part through methods such as shot peening, roll forming, and internal extrusion, creating a hardened layer measuring 0.3 to 1.5 mm in thickness on the surface. Shot peening involves blasting high-velocity projectiles onto a component's surface, inducing intense plastic deformation in the metal material and creating a cold-worked layer with elevated residual stresses—known as the shot-peened layer. Shot peening enhances a material's resistance to fatigue fracture, preventing fatigue failure, plastic deformation, and brittle fracture while extending its fatigue life. It is suitable for use in a wide range of industries, including machinery, aerospace, marine applications, petroleum, mining, railways, transportation, heavy machinery, and military equipment. Rolling enhancement involves using a diamond or other type of rolling head to apply a specific rolling force onto the surface of a part. A method that induces hardening of the rolled surface through strain-induced strengthening, thereby enhancing the mechanical properties of the component's surface. Surface Heat Treatment Strengthening and Chemical Heat Treatment Strengthening (1) Surface heat treatment strengthening. Surface heat treatment is a metal heat treatment process that involves heating only the surface layer of a workpiece to alter its mechanical properties. To heat only the surface of the workpiece without allowing excessive heat to penetrate into its interior, the heat source used must have a high energy density—meaning it delivers significant thermal energy over a small area of the workpiece, enabling the surface or specific regions to reach extremely high temperatures in a short or even instantaneous time. The main methods of surface heat treatment include flame quenching and induction heating, while common heat sources include flames such as oxy-acetylene or oxy-propane, as well as induced currents, lasers, and electron beams. (2) Surface chemical heat treatment strengthening. Surface chemical heat treatment is a metal heat treatment process that alters the chemical composition, microstructure, and properties of a workpiece's surface layer. Unlike surface heat treatment, which primarily modifies the material's surface properties through temperature changes, surface chemical heat treatment specifically targets the chemical composition of the surface layer. Chemical heat treatment involves heating a workpiece in a medium containing carbon, nitrogen, or other alloying elements—such as gas, liquid, or solid—and holding it at that temperature for an extended period. This process allows elements like carbon, nitrogen, boron, and chromium to diffuse into the surface of the workpiece. After diffusion, additional heat treatment processes, such as quenching and tempering, may be carried out as needed. The main methods of chemical heat treatment include carburizing, nitriding, and metal impregnation. 3) Laser Surface Treatment Heating is achieved using a laser beam, which rapidly melts a thin layer of the workpiece surface to a specific depth. Simultaneously, alloy elements are applied to the workpiece surface via methods such as vacuum evaporation, electroplating, or ion implantation. Under laser irradiation, these elements fully fuse with the base metal, and after solidification, a specially engineered alloy layer—ranging from 10 to 1,000 micrometers thick—is formed on the mold surface, exhibiting unique properties. The cooling rate during this process is equivalent to… Quenching with Rapid Cooling: A Case Study Tutorial on Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Mechatronic Systems
1) Categories of Equipment Maintenance Plans The time-phased plans include: ① The annual maintenance plan, which encompasses all major, medium, and minor repair schedules for the enterprise throughout the year, as well as regular equipment maintenance and upgrade/installation plans. This plan should be completed by the end of the previous year. ② The quarterly maintenance plan, derived from the annual plan, further breaks down the yearly objectives into more detailed tasks. It also allows for timely adjustments and additions to project timelines and sequences based on actual conditions, typically finalized during the last month of the preceding quarter. ③ The monthly maintenance plan, which is even more specific and meticulous than the quarterly plan, serves as the operational blueprint for executing maintenance activities. Critical tasks such as routine upkeep, periodic inspections, and scheduled diagnostics must all be incorporated into the monthly plan. Additionally, any issues identified during the previous month’s routine checks will be addressed by scheduling minor repairs this month. Plans categorized by maintenance type usually consist of the annual major overhaul plan and the annual equipment preventive maintenance schedule. The budget is primarily intended for corporate finance departments to prepare funds for major repairs and control major repair expenses. Some companies also prepare budgets for itemized repairs and minor maintenance tasks. Detailed schedule for maintenance, preventive testing, and regular precision adjustments."

This, in turn, allows for the full realization of equipment potential, enabling businesses to better meet production goals. Especially in modern manufacturing, prioritizing sound equipment management is a fundamental principle that must be followed. Equipment maintenance management is an important component of enterprise management. Its primary tasks include: maximizing Effectively collecting and utilizing equipment information resources allows for the strategic management of manpower, materials, funds, equipment, and technology within the maintenance system, ensuring that maintenance operations achieve optimal quality and maximum efficiency. The key components of maintenance management include maintenance information management, maintenance planning, maintenance technology, process and quality control, spare parts management, and maintenance economic management. In modern enterprises, management is inseparable from technology, while the effective application of engineering technologies relies on sound management practices. Equipment engineering technicians, who are well-versed in equipment maintenance management principles and methods, should seamlessly integrate technical expertise with managerial skills. To this end, this section will outline the key aspects, methodologies, and practical applications of equipment maintenance management. 1.5.2 Information Management for Equipment Maintenance In corporate equipment maintenance activities, it is often necessary to make various technical and economic decisions, and the basis for these decisions is information. Breath. Without a systematic and reliable information system, effective management becomes difficult to implement. Therefore, the task of equipment maintenance information management is to establish a comprehensive information system that collects, stores, and organizes all types of equipment-related data, while also enabling data processing, output, and feedback—ultimately supporting informed economic and technical decision-making for equipment management. 1. Classification of Equipment Maintenance Information Equipment maintenance information can be complex, but it can generally be categorized using the following methods. 1) Categorized by equipment in the early versus later stages This classification method divides equipment information into two major systems—early-stage and later-stage—and further breaks them down into numerous subsystems. Within these subsystems, various types of equipment are grouped, ultimately leading to a detailed breakdown for each individual device. The approach is straightforward and clear, making it easy to process, organize, and access the information. 2) Categorized by equipment management objectives and performance indicators
Usage guidelines include strengthening equipment management, establishing and rigorously enforcing operating procedures, enhancing inspection and maintenance of mechanical equipment, avoiding overloading, and preventing localized overloads or overheating.

Component Repair Method By treating equipment components as the primary focus of maintenance—replacing entire components during repairs—the process allows for disassembly, reassembly of parts, and even manufacturing tasks to be carried out after the component has been replaced. This approach significantly reduces downtime during maintenance. However, the component-based repair method requires maintaining a certain inventory of spare parts, which ties up some working capital. For companies that own large numbers of similar equipment, this method is particularly well-suited. Component Repair Method Some machinery and equipment experience heavy production loads, making it difficult to schedule ample time for major overhauls. In such cases, the sectional maintenance method can be employed. This approach involves repairing different components of the equipment at separate times—rather than all at once—by systematically and sequentially addressing each independent part of the machine, focusing on just one section at a time. The key advantage of sectional maintenance is that it allows organizations to take advantage of holidays Repairs are carried out during non-production hours to maximize machine uptime and improve equipment utilization. The sectional repair method is suitable for machinery with structurally independent components, as well as equipment requiring lengthy maintenance periods—such as modular machine tools and heavy-duty transportation equipment. 3) Synchronized Maintenance Method The synchronized maintenance method involves arranging several pieces of equipment, which are interconnected in the production process, to undergo maintenance simultaneously, thereby achieving synchronized upkeep and minimizing downtime associated with decentralized repairs. This approach is commonly applied to equipment on assembly lines, particularly to main units, auxiliary machines, and supporting systems within integrated production lines. The implementation of the single-equipment maintenance plan involves the following steps: (1) Delivery for Repair. The equipment user unit shall deliver the equipment to the repair unit on the date specified in the maintenance plan. During the handover, a thorough inspection and verification must be conducted, and the ""Equipment Handover Form"" should be completed in duplicate, with each party retaining one copy. After the equipment completion and acceptance, both parties shall count the equipment as per the ""Equipment Handover Form,"" along with the accompanying accessories and specialized tools that were transferred together. (2) Maintenance and Construction. During the maintenance process, the following key steps should generally be carefully managed: ① Dismantling Inspection: After the equipment is disassembled, the lead technician and maintenance workers will promptly inspect the components for wear and failure. Special attention should be paid to identifying any issues that were either undetected or unforeseen prior to the repair process. Additionally, the following technical documents and drawings should be issued as soon as possible: a detailed list of parts to be repaired or replaced, based on inspection findings; an updated and supplemented bill of materials; revised and supplementary sections of the maintenance technical specification sheet; and temporary manufacturing drawings for any custom-made components. Planning and scheduling personnel, together with the maintenance team leader, will revise and adjust the maintenance work plan based on the actual situation, then post it at the construction site so that all involved personnel can stay informed about the project progress. ② Production scheduling. The maintenance team leader must daily monitor the actual progress of repair work on each component and mark it clearly with a red line on the work schedule. If a task is found to be delayed, the team leader can reallocate resources based on the time buffers indicated in the network plan to get the project back on track. Planning and scheduling personnel should daily review the progress of work plans, paying close attention to the pace of tasks on critical paths. They should collaborate with technicians, workers, and team leaders to promptly address any issues arising during construction. Additionally, emphasis should be placed on ensuring smooth coordination among different trades to prevent idle time, material shortages, and delays that could impact project timelines. ③ Process Quality Inspection: After maintenance personnel complete each process and pass their own self-inspection, the work must be inspected by a quality control inspector. Only after confirmation of compliance can it proceed to the next process. For critical processes that pass inspection, a label should be affixed. ④ Progress in manufacturing temporary components. The progress of manufacturing temporary parts often becomes the primary factor delaying repair work. To address this, meticulously schedule processing steps for each critical component and implement measures to ensure they remain ready for use without delay.

1.1.4 Management of Failures Equipment failure management is a critical component of overall equipment maintenance. Effectively leveraging the fault information generated during equipment operation—by analyzing data from multiple perspectives and predicting potential failures—and subsequently implementing proactive measures to minimize equipment-related losses are essential for enhancing overall equipment management practices. Establishing a procedure for managing enterprise equipment failures is the first step in building an accident early-warning mechanism, and correctly developing such a procedure is of great significance. To effectively manage equipment failures, it’s essential to thoroughly understand the root causes of breakdowns, systematically collect data and information on common and typical failures, conduct in-depth failure analyses, emphasize research into failure patterns and mechanisms, and strengthen routine maintenance, inspections, and preventive repairs. The purpose of equipment failure management is to monitor and diagnose equipment conditions before failures occur, enabling operators to identify any signs of degradation. This proactive approach aims to detect early warning indicators and potential risks, allowing for timely preventive maintenance to effectively control the occurrence of failures. After a failure does happen, the process involves promptly analyzing the root cause, developing targeted solutions, and implementing measures to either resolve the issue or improve the equipment—ultimately preventing future occurrences.

Additionally, an alert notification can be automatically triggered when the current stock level drops below the predefined warning threshold. (5) Other functions. The computer system can also provide service functionalities to the maintenance system, including personnel management, financial management, and technical and process management. 1.5.3 Equipment Maintenance Plan Management The enterprise's equipment management department conducts planned, appropriately scaled maintenance on its equipment. When carrying out specific maintenance tasks, it’s also essential to organize resources effectively to ensure the progress, quality, and efficiency of the repairs. This planning and organizational process is known as Maintenance Planning Management. It comprises two key components: first, a macro-level maintenance plan (including annual, quarterly, and monthly schedules); and second, a detailed tutorial on micro-level mechanical and electrical system fault diagnosis and repair cases. 46 The work plan refers to a specific operational process, such as a major overhaul schedule for a machine, and is characterized by its closer relationship to process technology. Standard Workload for Equipment Maintenance The equipment maintenance work quotas serve as the basis for developing equipment maintenance plans and organizing repair operations. Accurately establishing these maintenance quotas enhances the scientific rigor and predictive capability of maintenance planning, facilitates thorough preparation before repairs begin, and ensures that maintenance activities are conducted in a more cost-effective and rational manner. Before drafting mechanical and electrical equipment maintenance plans, it is essential to first define various maintenance quotas. The main equipment maintenance quotas include: equipment maintenance complexity factor, maintenance labor-hour quota, maintenance downtime quota, maintenance cycle and interval period, and maintenance cost quota. 1) Equipment Maintenance Complexity Factor The equipment maintenance complexity factor, also known as the maintenance complexity unit or simply the maintenance unit, is a hypothetical measure used to assess the intricacy of equipment repair tasks, determine the associated workload, and establish standard benchmarks for various metrics. This assumed unit represents the maintenance effort required for a specific type of machinery, with its value determined by factors such as the equipment's structural design, dimensions, size, and precision levels. In general, the more complex the equipment's structure, the larger its physical dimensions, and the higher the machining accuracy demanded, the greater its maintenance complexity factor will be. For instance, in metal-cutting machine tools, the C620 lathe—typically featuring a maximum workpiece diameter of 400 mm and a maximum workpiece length of 1,000 mm—is often used as the benchmark machine. Its maintenance complexity factor is standardized at 10. As for electrical equipment, the focus shifts to… A protected cage-type synchronous motor with a rated power of 0.6 kW is standard equipment, and its maintenance complexity factor is specified as 1. For other machinery and equipment, the maintenance complexity factor can be determined by comparing their structure, size, precision, and other characteristics to those of the standard unit. Once a labor quota for one maintenance unit (represented by ""R"") has been established, the maintenance workload for any other type of machine can be calculated based on this unit. Additionally, maintenance downtime quotas and cost estimates can also be derived using the maintenance unit as a benchmark. The enterprise's supervisory authority has determined the maintenance complexity factors for various types of equipment and machine tools (establishing separate complexity factors for mechanical and electrical systems), and formulated these into company standards for use during equipment maintenance activities.
1.5.1 The Significance of Equipment Management Strengthening equipment management and ensuring proper maintenance will keep machinery consistently in excellent condition, thereby extending its lifespan. This not only plays a critical role in boosting production volume and variety, enhancing labor productivity, reducing consumption, lowering costs, and safeguarding worker safety—but also significantly contributes to upgrading the company’s overall production technology, accelerating industrial growth, and protecting productive capacity. Equipment management is an extremely important task—only by effectively managing equipment can organizations achieve optimal economic results with minimal human, financial, and material resources. This, in turn, allows for the full realization of equipment potential, enabling businesses to better meet production goals. Especially in modern manufacturing, prioritizing sound equipment management is a fundamental principle that must be followed. Equipment maintenance management is an important component of enterprise management. Its primary tasks include: maximizing Effectively collecting and utilizing equipment information resources allows for the strategic management of manpower, materials, funds, equipment, and technology within the maintenance system, ensuring that maintenance operations achieve optimal quality and maximum efficiency. The key components of maintenance management include maintenance information management, maintenance planning, maintenance technology, process and quality control, spare parts management, and maintenance economic management. In modern enterprises, management is inseparable from technology, while the effective application of engineering technologies relies on sound management practices. Equipment engineering technicians, who are well-versed in equipment maintenance management principles and methods, should seamlessly integrate technical expertise with managerial skills. To this end, this section will outline the key aspects, methodologies, and practical applications of equipment maintenance management. 1.5.2 Information Management for Equipment Maintenance In corporate equipment maintenance activities, it is often necessary to make various technical and economic decisions, and the basis for these decisions is information. Breath. Without a systematic and reliable information system, effective management becomes difficult to implement. Therefore, the task of equipment maintenance information management is to establish a comprehensive information system that collects, stores, and organizes all types of equipment-related data, while also enabling data processing, output, and feedback—ultimately supporting informed economic and technical decision-making for equipment management. 1. Classification of Equipment Maintenance Information Equipment maintenance information can be complex, but it can generally be categorized using the following methods. 1) Categorized by equipment in the early versus later stages This classification method divides equipment information into two major systems—early-stage and later-stage—and further breaks them down into numerous subsystems. Within these subsystems, various types of equipment are grouped, ultimately leading to a detailed breakdown for each individual device. The approach is straightforward and clear, making it easy to process, organize, and access the information. 2) Categorized by equipment management objectives and performance indicators
3. Reliability Maintenance Also known as Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM), this approach emerged in the U.S. civil aviation industry during the 1960s and is now widely implemented in industries with particularly high demands for equipment operational reliability, such as the nuclear and military sectors. While the time it takes for a potential failure in operating equipment to evolve into a functional failure can vary, all failure patterns eventually reveal detectable trends through systematic monitoring. This technique leverages these predictable patterns to implement proactive maintenance measures—making it a reliability-focused maintenance strategy aimed at enhancing equipment dependability. Rooted in reliability theory, RCM involves detailed analysis and experimentation of factors influencing system reliability, followed by the application of logical decision-making processes. This approach enables the scientific development of tailored maintenance plans, the optimal selection of repair methods, and the precise determination of equipment lifespan—all designed to maintain and restore the inherent reliability of assets while minimizing costs. Reliability-based maintenance is advancing equipment repair work toward greater scientific rigor and modernization, making it worthy of further attention and research. 4. Quality Maintenance This is an equipment maintenance procedure developed with a focus on ensuring product quality, aiming to keep all critical quality characteristics of product components and parts in optimal condition. To achieve this goal, the method manages key factors influencing quality—such as people, machines, and materials—and places particular emphasis on the relationship between equipment performance and product quality. It employs tools from Total Quality Management, including graphical techniques like Pareto charts, as well as statistical analysis methods. By closely monitoring product quality conditions, the process identifies problematic production steps, pinpointing faulty equipment areas and their root causes, and then systematically categorizes and organizes this information. Based on the severity of each issue, critical problems are prioritized, analyzed one by one, and targeted recovery measures are formulated. For chronic quality issues where the root cause remains unclear, PM analysis (Process-Machine Phenomenon Analysis) is utilized to investigate further. Perform a root cause analysis to identify the reasons and solutions, and establish a management system to prevent future failures.
Material details, etc. 6. Maintenance-Free Design Maintenance-free design is the ideal goal for equipment maintenance—it refers to implementing improvement measures during the design phase of new machinery and electrical equipment to address common failures encountered during maintenance, aiming to minimize maintenance efforts or even eliminate the need for repairs altogether. 1.2.2 Maintenance Method Selection The purpose of maintenance is to ensure the reliable operation of equipment—specifically, to guarantee the dependable fulfillment of its intended use—and, at the same time, minimize maintenance costs. Therefore, the fundamental requirements for maintenance decisions are: ① Reliability must not fall below the permissible minimum value [R], meaning that ()[] R ≥ R(t); ② Maintenance costs (KI) must be kept as low as possible—or, alternatively, must not exceed a predetermined maintenance cost limit (KImin), i.e., K ≤ KImin. To optimize maintenance decisions, the first step should be to choose an appropriate maintenance approach. The six maintenance methods mentioned above each have a specific scope of applicability; however, their effectiveness can vary depending on how appropriately they are applied. To maximize equipment efficiency, minimize downtime-related losses, and reduce maintenance costs, it’s essential to select the most suitable approach based on the characteristics of mechatronic systems and the conditions under which they are used. Looking ahead, the trend in maintenance practices is shifting from routine preventive maintenance toward planned, periodic inspections—and then, based on inspection findings, scheduling timely condition-based repairs. As the technological sophistication of factory equipment continues to rise, with increasingly complex system designs and broader adoption of mechatronic solutions, production activities are becoming more reliant on equipment performance and reliability. Consequently, the traditional static approach to maintenance management is evolving into a more dynamic model, gradually moving toward advanced strategies such as reliability-centered maintenance and quality-focused repair practices. Mechatronic equipment comes in a wide variety of types and is widely applied, making it essential to select one or a combination of maintenance methods tailored to the specific situation. When choosing a maintenance approach for mechatronic systems, reliability typically becomes the primary focus. For critical components, implementing condition-based monitoring allows for timely preventive measures. Meanwhile, for equipment at quality control points, it’s crucial to closely track changes in product quality during the manufacturing process and promptly address any detected anomalies through quality repairs. Additionally, it’s important to equip teams with personnel who are well-versed in microelectronics technology, providing them with supervision and guidance while fostering the development of skilled, integrated mechatronics technicians. Regular inspections and logical fault analysis should be conducted on CNC and other mechatronic systems, and any failed components identified must be promptly replaced and properly adjusted to ensure optimal performance. 1.2.3 Maintenance System Maintenance work is not only a technical task but also a managerial one. A maintenance system refers to a set of guidelines established under specific maintenance theories and principles, encompassing elements such as maintenance plans, categories, methods, timing, scope, levels, organizational structures, and performance evaluation metrics. Implementing a rational maintenance system helps optimize the allocation of human, material, and financial resources, enabling timely preparation before maintenance tasks, ensuring repairs are carried out appropriately, meeting operational requirements, enhancing the technical condition, reliability, and service life of机电 equipment, reducing downtime, and minimizing maintenance costs and production losses due to equipment shutdowns. Meanwhile, maintenance systems are continuously evolving and improving—currently, the main approaches include the following: Planned Preventive Maintenance System It is based on a thorough understanding of the wear and failure patterns of mechanical and electrical equipment, applying the principle of pre vention being better than cure—and addressing potential issues before they escalate—by systematically organizing maintenance and repairs according to the rate of wear and expected  service life of each component. This approach helps prevent premature wear, compensates for natural degradation, minimizes or avoids failures altogether, extends equipment lifespan , and ultimately saves time spent on repairs, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and boosting economic returns. The practical implementation of planned preventive maintenance  can be summarized as  ""regular inspections, timely upkeep, and scheduled repairs, "" making it particularly suitable for Chapter 1 of this guide: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment. 11 Macro-level management. I mplementing a planned preventive maintenance system requires the following conditions: ① Determining the maintenance intervals for assemblies and key components through statistical analysis, measurements, and experimental studies, and rationally categorizing mainten ance tasks;
The degree is very high. Choose a reasonable running-in load, relative motion speed, and lubrication. Slip conditions and other parameters are key to shortening the break-in period. 2) Stable Wear Phase AB The wear characteristic of this stage is a low and stable wear rate, which is why the duration of this phase is relatively long. But by mid- Figure 1.3: Wear Characteristic Curve –  Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance 19 Later on, the wear rate becomes relatively faster, but the equipment can still fu nction for a while. When the wear amount reaches point B, the wear rate sharply accelerates, marking the onset of the severe wear phase. Proper usage, along with regular maintenanc e and upkeep of the equipment, is key to extending this critical stage. 3) Rapid Wear Phase BC Once this stage is reached, significant changes in friction conditions occur, such as  altered lubrication or shifts in the geometric dimensions of components. Changes, such as increased clearance between mating parts and the generation of impact loads, can cause we ar rates to rise sharply. At this point, mechanical efficiency noticeably declines, and precision deteriorates—conditions that, if left unaddressed, could lead to equipment failure  or even unexpected accidents. Therefore, promptly identifying and repairing components that are about to enter this stage is critically important. According to wear results, wear  is categorized into pitting wear, adhesive wear, abrasive wear, and more; while based on wear mechanisms, it is classified into abrasive wear, fatigue wear, adhesive wear, fretting  wear, and others. Abrasive wear occurs when a hard protruding part on one surface of a friction pair comes into contact with the other surface, or when abrasive particles are pres ent between the two rubbing surfaces. Wear occurs when hard particulates—such as dust in the air or metal particles generated by abrasion—cause material transfer from one surface t o another, or even simultaneous material loss on both surfaces, during relative motion. Among the many wear failure modes, abrasive wear is not only the most common but also the mo st severe type of failure. Fretting wear refers to a type of wear where localized areas on the surfaces of friction pairs develop fatigue cracks under cyclic contact stresses, lead ing to the detachment of micro-sheets or particles. Depending on the nature of contact and relative motion between the friction pairs, fretting wear can be categorized into two mai n forms: rolling-contact fatigue wear and sliding-contact fatigue wear. In practical applications, pure rolling-contact fatigue wear is relatively rare; most often, it occurs as a  combination of rolling and sliding motions. Adhesive wear occurs when, at the points of contact between mating surfaces,  ""cold welding "" takes place, causing material from one surface to transfer to the other during relative sliding. Micro-motion wear is a type of wear that occurs when two contacting objects under go relative vibrations with very small amplitudes. It happens on two closely matched surfaces that appear nominally stationary but actually experience cyclic, minute-scale relative  sliding—typically at the micrometer level (2–20 μm). For instance, this phenomenon can be observed at interference or transition-fit interfaces between shafts and holes, on keyway  surfaces, or in threaded fasteners. Wear occurring on working surfaces, such as the working surface of the rivet, and other similar areas. Fretting wear not only reduces mating ac curacy, loosens tight-fitting components, and degrades the quality of the mating surfaces, but can also lead to the formation of fatigue cracks, significantly diminishing the fatig ue strength of the part. 2.

When determining the failure cause of a part, consider the material properties, manufacturing process, load conditions, assembly quality, and years of use. Carefully examine and analyze factors such as the medium and temperature in the working environment, as well as the usage conditions of similar parts, before combining this information with the macroscopic and microscopic features of the fracture surface to make an accurate assessment and identify the primary and secondary causes of the failure. 7) Identify Failure Countermeasures Once the cause of failure is identified, targeted solutions are proposed to effectively leverage existing conditions and prevent fracture incidents from occurring.

Enterprise authorities, investors, and business operators all need to understand and monitor key indicators, such as output value per ten thousand yuan. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance 45 Repair costs, equipment integrity rate, maintenance expenses per 10,000 yuan of equipment value, and more. To facilitate statistical analysis, equipment information can be categorized into five main types: investment planning data, asset and spare parts information, technical condition data, maintenance schedule details, and personnel information. Each category can further be broken down into numerous sub-items and specific evaluation metrics, making it easier to conduct comprehensive classification-based analysis. 3) Categorized from a maintenance perspective Equipment information can be categorized into equipment status information, equipment maintenance information, equipment failure or accident information, repair work information, repair material information, repair personnel information, repair cost information, and related information, among others. 2. Functions of the Computer Repair Information System In modern enterprises, a computer maintenance information system can either serve as a subsystem within the company's management system or operate as an independent system altogether. The functionality of a computer maintenance information system is closely tied to the configuration of both the hardware and software components of computers. Currently, several versatile equipment management software solutions have already been integrated into the system software. The computer maintenance information system offers the following key functions in equipment repair and management: 1) Process Control Function The process control function can be used to monitor equipment operating conditions and detect key performance parameters such as vibration, noise, ultrasound, temperature rise, cooling status, lubrication condition, and environmental factors, providing critical information to guide maintenance activities. 2) Engineering Design and Calculation Functionality The engineering design and calculation function enables mechanical analysis and computations for various equipment and maintenance tooling, as well as supports computer-aided design and drafting, along with diverse optimization processes. 3) Information Processing Function The information processing function handles various types of data in maintenance management, covering the following 5 aspects: (1) Equipment Ledger Management. Store the original data and documentation for all company equipment in a computer system, allowing you to generate workshop equipment ledgers and equipment lists by model—in various formats—as needed. (2) Equipment classification, sorting, querying, and retrieval. Categorize and sort equipment supply information available in the market, storing it in the system to provide insights when companies update or add new equipment. (3) Equipment Maintenance Planning Management. When determining equipment maintenance plans, you can refer to equipment records, maintenance information, and diagnostic data stored in the computer system, and, based on actual conditions, use the computer to develop annual, quarterly, and monthly equipment maintenance schedules. (4) Maintenance Spare Parts Management. By entering the enterprise equipment maintenance spare parts’ demand information, inventory details, and inbound/outbound records into the computer system, users can instantly access real-time inventory status and generate statistical reports. Additionally, an alert notification can be automatically triggered when the current stock level drops below the predefined warning threshold. (5) Other functions. The computer system can also provide service functionalities to the maintenance system, including personnel management, financial management, and technical and process management. 1.5.3 Equipment Maintenance Plan Management The enterprise's equipment management department conducts planned, appropriately scaled maintenance on its equipment. When carrying out specific maintenance tasks, it’s also essential to organize resources effectively to ensure the progress, quality, and efficiency of the repairs. This planning and organizational process is known as Maintenance Planning Management. It comprises two key components: first, a macro-level maintenance plan (including annual, quarterly, and monthly schedules); and second, a detailed tutorial on micro-level mechanical and electrical system fault diagnosis and repair cases. 46 The work plan refers to a specific operational process, such as a major overhaul schedule for a machine, and is characterized by its closer relationship to process technology. Standard Workload for Equipment Maintenance The equipment maintenance work quotas serve as the basis for developing equipment maintenance plans and organizing repair operations. Accurately establishing these maintenance quotas enhances the scientific rigor and predictive capability of maintenance planning, facilitates thorough preparation before repairs begin, and ensures that maintenance activities are conducted in a more cost-effective and rational manner. Before drafting mechanical and electrical equipment maintenance plans, it is essential to first define various maintenance quotas. The main equipment maintenance quotas include: equipment maintenance complexity factor, maintenance labor-hour quota, maintenance downtime quota, maintenance cycle and interval period, and maintenance cost quota. 1) Equipment Maintenance Complexity Factor The equipment maintenance complexity factor, also known as the maintenance complexity unit or simply the maintenance unit, is a hypothetical measure used to assess the intricacy of equipment repair tasks, determine the associated workload, and establish standard benchmarks for various metrics.

The enterprise's supervisory authority has determined the maintenance complexity factors for various types of equipment and machine tools (establishing separate complexity factors for mechanical and electrical systems), and formulated these into company standards for use during equipment maintenance activities.
2) Standardized Maintenance Labor Quotas The maintenance labor quota refers to the amount of labor time required by a company to complete various repair tasks for machinery and equipment, typically expressed as the number of work hours needed for a single repair complexity factor. For example, the labor quota for a major overhaul of a machine tool with one repair complexity factor includes 40 hours for fitters, 20 hours for machining operations, and 4 hours for other trades, totaling 64 hours. 3) Standardized Maintenance Downtime Rates The standard maintenance downtime refers to the time taken from when equipment is handed over for repair until the repair is completed and accepted. This duration is determined based on the maintenance complexity factor. Generally speaking, the higher the maintenance complexity factor, the more intricate the equipment's structure—and most of these devices are critical, key components in production that significantly impact operational efficiency. Therefore, it is essential to minimize maintenance downtime as much as possible to ensure smooth production processes. 4) Maintenance Cycle and Maintenance Interval The maintenance cycle is the operating time of machinery and equipment between two consecutive overhauls. For new equipment, it refers to the period from the start of production until the first major overhaul. The maintenance cycle is determined comprehensively based on factors such as the equipment’s structural and process characteristics, the type of production and nature of work, the level of maintenance and repair practices, the materials being processed, and the allowable wear limits of equipment components. The maintenance interval is the operating time of machinery and equipment between two consecutive maintenance sessions. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance 47 The inspection interval is the operating time of machinery and equipment between two consecutive inspections—or between an inspection and the subsequent maintenance. 5) Standardized Repair Costs The maintenance cost quota refers to the prescribed expense standard for completing machinery and equipment repairs—it serves as a financial benchmark for evaluating maintenance work. Companies should prioritize the economic efficiency of maintenance efforts and continuously strive to reduce the maintenance cost quota. 2. Maintenance Plan Development
3. Gear Inspection After gears have operated for a period of time, tooth profile errors increase due to wear on the tooth surfaces, which ultimately affects their performance. Therefore, it is essential that the gear teeth remain intact, with no signs of extrusion deformation, cracks, or broken teeth. Additionally, wear on the tooth thickness should be kept within limits—not exceeding 0.15 times the module. In production, specialized gear thickness calipers are commonly used to check for deviations in tooth thickness, effectively controlling backlash by measuring the reduction in tooth thickness. Alternatively, a universal involute micrometer can be employed to assess variations in the length of the gear’s normal chord, ensuring precise gear motion accuracy. This method is simple and practical, making it widely adopted in manufacturing processes. Furthermore, the gear’s internal bore, keyways, splines, and threads must all meet standard specifications, with no instances of scoring or damage allowed. 2.5.3 Gear Maintenance and Repair The methods for gear repair are primarily determined based on the gear's failure mode, production technology conditions, and application requirements. For small to medium module gears, if spare parts are readily available, repairs are typically avoided in favor of replacing the gear entirely with a new one. However, when replacing gears, it’s generally recommended to swap them in pairs to ensure optimal meshing performance. If spare parts aren’t sufficient, large gears can be repaired using precision finishing techniques, while smaller gears are replaced altogether. For worn-out large-module gears, dimensional restoration can be achieved through spraying, followed by fine finishing of the tooth surfaces. In cases where large-module gears suffer from broken teeth or cracks, repair methods such as tooth insertion or weld patching are employed. 2.5.4 Assembly and Adjustment of Cylindrical Gears

1.5.1 The Significance of Equipment Management Strengthening equipment management and ensuring proper maintenance will keep machinery consistently in excellent condition, thereby extending its lifespan. This not only plays a critical role in boosting production volume and variety, enhancing labor productivity, reducing consumption, lowering costs, and safeguarding worker safety—but also significantly contributes to upgrading the company’s overall production technology, accelerating industrial growth, and protecting productive capacity. Equipment management is an extremely important task—only by effectively managing equipment can organizations achieve optimal economic results with minimal human, financial, and material resources. This, in turn, allows for the full realization of equipment potential, enabling businesses to better meet production goals. Especially in modern manufacturing, prioritizing sound equipment management is a fundamental principle that must be followed. Equipment maintenance management is an important component of enterprise management. Its primary tasks include: maximizing Effectively collecting and utilizing equipment information resources allows for the strategic management of manpower, materials, funds, equipment, and technology within the maintenance system, ensuring that maintenance operations achieve optimal quality and maximum efficiency. The key components of maintenance management include maintenance information management, maintenance planning, maintenance technology, process and quality control, spare parts management, and maintenance economic management. In modern enterprises, management is inseparable from technology, while the effective application of engineering technologies relies on sound management practices. Equipment engineering technicians, who are well-versed in equipment maintenance management principles and methods, should seamlessly integrate technical expertise with managerial skills. To this end, this section will outline the key aspects, methodologies, and practical applications of equipment maintenance management. 1.5.2 Information Management for Equipment Maintenance In corporate equipment maintenance activities, it is often necessary to make various technical and economic decisions, and the basis for these decisions is information. Breath. Without a systematic and reliable information system, effective management becomes difficult to implement. Therefore, the task of equipment maintenance information management is to establish a comprehensive information system that collects, stores, and organizes all types of equipment-related data, while also enabling data processing, output, and feedback—ultimately supporting informed economic and technical decision-making for equipment management. 1. Classification of Equipment Maintenance Information Equipment maintenance information can be complex, but it can generally be categorized using the following methods. 1) Categorized by equipment in the early versus later stages This classification method divides equipment information into two major systems—early-stage and later-stage—and further breaks them down into numerous subsystems. Within these subsystems, various types of equipment are grouped, ultimately leading to a detailed breakdown for each individual device. The approach is straightforward and clear, making it easy to process, organize, and access the information. 2) Categorized by equipment management objectives and performance indicators
Enterprise authorities, investors, and business operators all need to understand and monitor key indicators, such as output value per ten thousand yuan. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance 45 Repair costs, equipment integrity rate, maintenance expenses per 10,000 yuan of equipment value, and more. To facilitate statistical analysis, equipment information can be categorized into five main types: investment planning data, asset and spare parts information, technical condition data, maintenance schedule details, and personnel information. Each category can further be broken down into numerous sub-items and specific evaluation metrics, making it easier to conduct comprehensive classification-based analysis. 3) Categorized from a maintenance perspective Equipment information can be categorized into equipment status information, equipment maintenance information, equipment failure or accident information, repair work information, repair material information, repair personnel information, repair cost information, and related information, among others. 2. Functions of the Computer Repair Information System In modern enterprises, a computer maintenance information system can either serve as a subsystem within the company's management system or operate as an independent system altogether. The functionality of a computer maintenance information system is closely tied to the configuration of both the hardware and software components of computers. Currently, several versatile equipment management software solutions have already been integrated into the system software. The computer maintenance information system offers the following key functions in equipment repair and management: 1) Process Control Function The process control function can be used to monitor equipment operating conditions and detect key performance parameters such as vibration, noise, ultrasound, temperature rise, cooling status, lubrication condition, and environmental factors, providing critical information to guide maintenance activities. 2) Engineering Design and Calculation Functionality The engineering design and calculation function enables mechanical analysis and computations for various equipment and maintenance tooling, as well as supports computer-aided design and drafting, along with diverse optimization processes. 3) Information Processing Function The information processing function handles various types of data in maintenance management, covering the following 5 aspects: (1) Equipment Ledger Management. Store the original data and documentation for all company equipment in a computer system, allowing you to generate workshop equipment ledgers and equipment lists by model—in various formats—as needed. (2) Equipment classification, sorting, querying, and retrieval. Categorize and sort equipment supply information available in the market, storing it in the system to provide insights when companies update or add new equipment. (3) Equipment Maintenance Planning Management. When determining equipment maintenance plans, you can refer to equipment records, maintenance information, and diagnostic data stored in the computer system, and, based on actual conditions, use the computer to develop annual, quarterly, and monthly equipment maintenance schedules. (4) Maintenance Spare Parts Management. By entering the enterprise equipment maintenance spare parts’ demand information, inventory details, and inbound/outbound records into the computer system, users can instantly access real-time inventory status and generate statistical reports. Additionally, an alert notification can be automatically triggered when the current stock level drops below the predefined warning threshold. (5) Other functions. The computer system can also provide service functionalities to the maintenance system, including personnel management, financial management, and technical and process management. 1.5.3 Equipment Maintenance Plan Management The enterprise's equipment management department conducts planned, appropriately scaled maintenance on its equipment. When carrying out specific maintenance tasks, it’s also essential to organize resources effectively to ensure the progress, quality, and efficiency of the repairs. This planning and organizational process is known as Maintenance Planning Management. It comprises two key components: first, a macro-level maintenance plan (including annual, quarterly, and monthly schedules); and second, a detailed tutorial on micro-level mechanical and electrical system fault diagnosis and repair cases. 46 The work plan refers to a specific operational process, such as a major overhaul schedule for a machine, and is characterized by its closer relationship to process technology. Standard Workload for Equipment Maintenance The equipment maintenance work quotas serve as the basis for developing equipment maintenance plans and organizing repair operations. Accurately establishing these maintenance quotas enhances the scientific rigor and predictive capability of maintenance planning, facilitates thorough preparation before repairs begin, and ensures that maintenance activities are conducted in a more cost-effective and rational manner. Before drafting mechanical and electrical equipment maintenance plans, it is essential to first define various maintenance quotas. The main equipment maintenance quotas include: equipment maintenance complexity factor, maintenance labor-hour quota, maintenance downtime quota, maintenance cycle and interval period, and maintenance cost quota. 1) Equipment Maintenance Complexity Factor The equipment maintenance complexity factor, also known as the maintenance complexity unit or simply the maintenance unit, is a hypothetical measure used to assess the intricacy of equipment repair tasks, determine the associated workload, and establish standard benchmarks for various metrics. This assumed unit represents the maintenance effort required for a specific type of machinery, with its value determined by factors such as the equipment's structural design, dimensions, size, and precision levels. In general, the more complex the equipment's structure, the larger its physical dimensions, and the higher the machining accuracy demanded, the greater its maintenance complexity factor will be. For instance, in metal-cutting machine tools, the C620 lathe—typically featuring a maximum workpiece diameter of 400 mm and a maximum workpiece length of 1,000 mm—is often used as the benchmark machine. Its maintenance complexity factor is standardized at 10. As for electrical equipment, the focus shifts to… A protected cage-type synchronous motor with a rated power of 0.6 kW is standard equipment, and its maintenance complexity factor is specified as 1. For other machinery and equipment, the maintenance complexity factor can be determined by comparing their structure, size, precision, and other characteristics to those of the standard unit. Once a labor quota for one maintenance unit (represented by ""R"") has been established, the maintenance workload for any other type of machine can be calculated based on this unit. Additionally, maintenance downtime quotas and cost estimates can also be derived using the maintenance unit as a benchmark. The enterprise's supervisory authority has determined the maintenance complexity factors for various types of equipment and machine tools (establishing separate complexity factors for mechanical and electrical systems), and formulated these into company standards for use during equipment maintenance activities.
2) Standardized Maintenance Labor Quotas The maintenance labor quota refers to the amount of labor time required by a company to complete various repair tasks for machinery and equipment, typically expressed as the number of work hours needed for a single repair complexity factor. For example, the labor quota for a major overhaul of a machine tool with one repair complexity factor includes 40 hours for fitters, 20 hours for machining operations, and 4 hours for other trades, totaling 64 hours. 3) Standardized Maintenance Downtime Rates The standard maintenance downtime refers to the time taken from when equipment is handed over for repair until the repair is completed and accepted. This duration is determined based on the maintenance complexity factor. Generally speaking, the higher the maintenance complexity factor, the more intricate the equipment's structure—and most of these devices are critical, key components in production that significantly impact operational efficiency. Therefore, it is essential to minimize maintenance downtime as much as possible to ensure smooth production processes. 4) Maintenance Cycle and Maintenance Interval The maintenance cycle is the operating time of machinery and equipment between two consecutive overhauls. For new equipment, it refers to the period from the start of production until the first major overhaul. The maintenance cycle is determined comprehensively based on factors such as the equipment’s structural and process characteristics, the type of production and nature of work, the level of maintenance and repair practices, the materials being processed, and the allowable wear limits of equipment components. The maintenance interval is the operating time of machinery and equipment between two consecutive maintenance sessions. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance 47 The inspection interval is the operating time of machinery and equipment between two consecutive inspections—or between an inspection and the subsequent maintenance. 5) Standardized Repair Costs The maintenance cost quota refers to the prescribed expense standard for completing machinery and equipment repairs—it serves as a financial benchmark for evaluating maintenance work. Companies should prioritize the economic efficiency of maintenance efforts and continuously strive to reduce the maintenance cost quota. 2. Maintenance Plan Development
1) Categories of Equipment Maintenance Plans The time-phased plans include: ① The annual maintenance plan, which encompasses all major, medium, and minor repair schedules for the enterprise throughout the year, as well as regular equipment maintenance and upgrade/installation plans. This plan should be completed by the end of the previous year. ② The quarterly maintenance plan, derived from the annual plan, further breaks down the yearly objectives into more detailed tasks. It also allows for timely adjustments and additions to project timelines and sequences based on actual conditions, typically finalized during the last month of the preceding quarter. ③ The monthly maintenance plan, which is even more specific and meticulous than the quarterly plan, serves as the operational blueprint for executing maintenance activities. Critical tasks such as routine upkeep, periodic inspections, and scheduled diagnostics must all be incorporated into the monthly plan. Additionally, any issues identified during the previous month’s routine checks will be addressed by scheduling minor repairs this month. Plans categorized by maintenance type usually consist of the annual major overhaul plan and the annual equipment preventive maintenance schedule. The budget is primarily intended for corporate finance departments to prepare funds for major repairs and control major repair expenses. Some companies also prepare budgets for itemized repairs and minor maintenance tasks. Detailed schedule for maintenance, preventive testing, and regular precision adjustments.
5. Improve Maintenance Improvement maintenance, also known as corrective maintenance, refers to a type of repair that enhances the technical performance of mechanical and electrical equipment to prevent recurring failures. It involves integrating maintenance activities with technological upgrades, ensuring that after repairs, key aspects such as precision, performance, and efficiency of the equipment are improved. Rate. During operation, mechanical and electrical equipment often has certain weak links, which necessitates technical improvements and structural modifications to specific devices or components. These enhancements aim to boost reliability and elevate the overall technological level of the equipment, ultimately leading to better economic outcomes. A key feature of improvement-based maintenance is its integrated approach, frequently combined with major overhauls and targeted repairs in actual production settings. When implementing such improvement maintenance, it’s essential to systematically address and refine the mechanisms of the equipment, as well as enhance the diagnostic and repair capabilities of electromechanical systems—based on thorough inspection and analysis of component failures. 10"

Before December each year, the enterprise's production planning department will issue the equipment maintenance plan for the following year, serving as the basis for  the company's operations.
The major overhaul process for mechanical and electrical equipment is typically divided into three stages: pre-repair preparation, the repair process itself, and post-repair acceptance. Pre-repair preparation phase To ensure the repair work proceeds smoothly and accurately, maintenance personnel should carefully listen to operators' requirements for equipment repairs and thoroughly understand the issues affecting the equipment being serviced—such as loss of precision, the extent of wear on major mechanical components, the accuracy of the transmission system, and any visible defects. They should also identify which parts need improvement or modification to meet the equipment’s operational specifications. Additionally, they should review relevant technical documentation, equipment manuals, and previous maintenance records to become familiar with the device’s structural features, transmission system, and original design precision standards. This preparation will enable them to propose comprehensive pre-inspection tasks. Following the pre-inspection, specific repair methods for critical and large components can be determined, allowing for the preparation of specialized tools and precision measuring instruments. Finally, the team must define the post-repair precision testing procedures and establish clear acceptance criteria for trial runs, ensuring all technical preparations are fully in place before proceeding with the complete overhaul of the equipment.
(4) Preparation of spare par ts, materials, and specialized tools, inspection equipment, and research fixtures. The lead technical personnel should promptly provide the management team with detailed lists of r eplacement parts, material specifications, as well as lists of specialized tools, inspection equipment, and research fixtures, along with relevant drawings. After verifying the inv entory, the management team will place orders or arrange for manufacturing to ensure that these items are available on time for use during major equipment overhauls. (5) Preparing  the Overhaul Work Plan. The overhaul work plan is prepared by the planning personnel in the maintenance department, who are responsible for equipment management. Personnel, chief t echnicians, and maintenance foremen (team leaders) review it together. The overhaul work plan includes: work procedures, the number of workers required for each phase and stage of  the job, along with the corresponding duration in days; requirements for seamless coordination between individual work phases; and details on projects that need to be outsourced to  external partners, including specific timeframes. A general overhaul work plan can be presented using a ""bar chart"" format, supplemented by necessary explanatory text. For overhauls of complex, high-precision, large-scale, and critical equipment, network scheduling techniques should be employed to ensure efficient resource utilization, shorten project timelines, and enhance overall economic benefits. 4.

1.4.1 Preparations Before Mechanical Equipment Maintenance Electromechanical equipment occupies a critically important position in the production and operational activities of modern industrial enterprises. To ensure smooth equipment operation and safe production, implementing planned preventive maintenance is an essential component of equipment management and repair practices in industrial companies. This section will cover the detailed process of major equipment overhauls, the determination of equipment repair plans, as well as the technical and material preparations required prior to equipment maintenance. 1. Equipment Major Overhaul Process To ensure the precision and operational performance of mechanical and electrical equipment, preventive scheduled maintenance must be carried out in addition to routine upkeep. Among these preventive measures, major overhauls stand out as a critical task aimed at restoring the equipment's accuracy. Within the category of preventive maintenance, major overhauls—often referred to simply as ""overhauls""—represent the most extensive and time-consuming type of repair. An overhaul involves completely or largely disassembling the equipment, repairing or replacing foundational components, refurbishing mechanical and electrical parts, recalibrating the electrical systems, and finally reassembling and fine-tuning the entire unit. The ultimate goal is to thoroughly eliminate any pre-existing defects and restore the equipment to its specified performance standards. The major steps involved in the overhaul of mechanical and electrical equipment typically include: pre-disassembly unit inspection, component removal, component inspection, necessary component disassembly, parts cleaning and examination, component repair and assembly, final assembly, no-load trial operation, load testing, overall machine precision verification, and final acceptance. In practice, these tasks should be carried out according to the overhaul work plan, while also ensuring effective job scheduling, quality control during operations, and thorough completion acceptance. The major overhaul process for mechanical and electrical equipment is typically divided into three stages: pre-repair preparation, the repair process itself, and post-repair acceptance. Pre-repair preparation phase To ensure the repair work proceeds smoothly and accurately, maintenance personnel should carefully listen to operators' requirements for equipment repairs and thoroughly understand the issues affecting the equipment being serviced—such as loss of precision, the extent of wear on major mechanical components, the accuracy of the transmission system, and any visible defects. They should also identify which parts need improvement or modification to meet the equipment’s operational specifications. Additionally, they should review relevant technical documentation, equipment manuals, and previous maintenance records to become familiar with the device’s structural features, transmission system, and original design precision standards. This preparation will enable them to propose comprehensive pre-inspection tasks. Following the pre-inspection, specific repair methods for critical and large components can be determined, allowing for the preparation of specialized tools and precision measuring instruments. Finally, the team must define the post-repair precision testing procedures and establish clear acceptance criteria for trial runs, ensuring all technical preparations are fully in place before proceeding with the complete overhaul of the equipment."

1) Categories of Equipment Maintenance Plans The time-phased plans include: ① The annual maintenance plan, which encompasses all major, medium, and minor repair schedules for the enterprise throughout the year, as well as regular equipment maintenance and upgrade/installation plans. This plan should be completed by the end of the previous year. ② The quarterly maintenance plan, derived from the annual plan, further breaks down the yearly objectives into more detailed tasks. It also allows for timely adjustments and additions to project timelines and sequences based on actual conditions, typically finalized during the last month of the preceding quarter. ③ The monthly maintenance plan, which is even more specific and meticulous than the quarterly plan, serves as the operational blueprint for executing maintenance activities. Critical tasks such as routine upkeep, periodic inspections, and scheduled diagnostics must all be incorporated into the monthly plan. Additionally, any issues identified during the previous month’s routine checks will be addressed by scheduling minor repairs this month. Plans categorized by maintenance type usually consist of the annual major overhaul plan and the annual equipment preventive maintenance schedule. The budget is primarily intended for corporate finance departments to prepare funds for major repairs and control major repair expenses. Some companies also prepare budgets for itemized repairs and minor maintenance tasks. Detailed schedule for maintenance, preventive testing, and regular precision adjustments.
(1) Basis for preparing the maintenance plan. ① The technical condition of equipment refers to its actual state in terms of technical performance, load capacity, transmission mechanisms, and operational safety. Key indicators reflecting the quality of a company’s equipment—including equipment integrity rate, failure downtime rate, and the extent to which equipment impacts balanced production—provide a clear picture of the overall technical condition. Information on equipment’s technical status is primarily gathered through comprehensive surveys and assessments of equipment conditions, as well as from original documentation. Typically, companies conduct equipment surveys during the third quarter of each year, with the main objective of identifying existing issues, proposing corrective measures, and completing the Equipment Technical Condition Survey Form, which then serves as the foundation for developing maintenance plans. Original records include daily inspections, routine checks, condition-monitoring logs, repair histories, and other primary documents, along with comprehensive analytical data. Equipment showing signs of deteriorating technical conditions and requiring maintenance should be included as items in the annual maintenance plan application. ② Requirements for equipment based on production processes and product quality. If the actual technical condition of the equipment fails to meet the process and quality standards for the product, the process department will submit a request to schedule planned maintenance.

3. Maintenance Work Plan Management When carrying out any specific equipment maintenance task, it is essential to develop a work plan. Utilizing network planning techniques to create these work plans optimizes job process management, ensures efficient use of all resources, shortens the repair timeline, and minimizes downtime-related losses. This approach is particularly suitable for major overhauls of large, complex equipment, as well as for planning project-based repairs and installation/adjustment projects involving such machinery. 4. Implementation of the Equipment Maintenance Plan Once the equipment maintenance plan is finalized, it must be strictly implemented to ensure its successful execution and strive to minimize downtime. Regular inspections of the plan's implementation are essential—these checks not only help maintain schedule adherence but also guarantee the quality of the repairs. After the maintenance work is completed, a joint inspection by relevant departments is mandatory. Each aspect of the equipment—such as precision and performance—must be thoroughly examined and verified against the established quality standards. Only when all criteria meet the repair quality benchmarks can we confidently ensure that production resumes smoothly. To minimize maintenance downtime and ensure the successful implementation of the plan, advanced maintenance organization methods can be employed depending on the specific situation. These methods primarily include the following three approaches: Chapter 1—Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance
The basic content of operation and maintenance procedures generally includes the following aspects. (1) Operators must wear appropriate personal protective equipment as required during operation. When inspecting or approaching the equipment, they should avoid wearing loose-fitting clothing. Female employees are not permitted to wear long hair loose. (2) Before starting work, clear the workspace. Before turning on the equipment, inspect each operating handle and control device according to the items specified in the daily inspection checklist to ensure they are in the off position. Check whether any components show signs of severe wear, damage requiring replacement, or loose connections posing safety risks. Verify that all safety protection devices are intact and securely fastened. Also, confirm that the power supply is functioning properly and keep a detailed inspection record. If any issues are found that fail to meet safety standards, promptly submit safety improvement suggestions or solutions to the workshop supervisor to prevent the equipment from operating while faulty. (3) Check whether the wires and control cabinets are damaged, whether the surrounding environment is reliable, and whether the equipment's grounding or earthing facilities are safe. If any issues are detected, take protective measures immediately. (4) Check the oil quality and level in lubrication and hydraulic systems; replenish oil according to the lubrication chart, ensuring the oil remains clean, the oil lines are unobstructed, and lubrication is optimal. Proper lubrication not only guarantees effective cooling and heat dissipation but also provides sealing and protective functions. Additionally, it plays a significant role in cleaning away contaminants and reducing wear. (5) After confirming that all components are functioning correctly, you may first run the machine at low speed for 3–5 minutes with no load. Ensure that all parts operate smoothly and are well-lubricated before proceeding with actual work. Never exceed the recommended load or use the equipment outside of specified guidelines. (6) While the equipment is running, it is strictly prohibited to adjust the workpiece by hand or to perform lubrication, remove debris, or wipe down the machine. When leaving the machine tool, always turn off the power supply. During operation, closely monitor the condition of all components; if any abnormalities are detected, immediately stop the machine and address the issue. (7) When maintaining, servicing, or cleaning equipment and instruments, ensure that the equipment and instruments are powered down and the power supply is completely turned off. Additionally, clearly display or hang warning signs at the work site to indicate that the equipment is undergoing maintenance or repair, or that personnel are present for ongoing work. (8) Before maintenance and servicing, personnel should be aware of the precautions specific to this task and follow the proper maintenance procedures. During maintenance, staff must remain fully focused, wear appropriate safety gear, and ensure their standing position is secure. (9) When maintaining equipment, use disassembly tools correctly; unauthorized assembly or disassembly is strictly prohibited. Do not remove or alter the equipment's Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance at will. 15 Safety protection device: When positioning or assembling the equipment, never insert your hands into the mating surfaces or use your fingers to align holes. (10) After completing maintenance, repair, and other operational tasks, equipment should be removed from the work area, and the workspace along with machinery must be thoroughly cleaned. Every component of the equipment’s instruments and gauges should be carefully inspected, ensuring that no tools or other items are left behind—either on the equipment or inside it. Additionally, the workshop should conduct regular maintenance, upkeep, and repairs to ensure the smooth operation of all machinery. (11) Instructions, safety signs, and signage located within the workshop and on machinery must be strictly followed at all times. (12) It is strictly prohibited to use flammable or volatile substances for wiping equipment. Oil-soaked rags must not be left on the equipment, and no flammable or explosive materials are allowed to be stored near the equipment. (13) When working in flammable and explosive hazard areas, appropriate safety measures must be taken beforehand and approved by the production safety department and management before proceeding. Additionally, when welding or grinding containers or pipelines containing flammable, explosive, or toxic materials, these must first be properly purged and thoroughly cleaned—and all openings must be fully opened—before work can begin. (14) The work area should be dry and clean. Used oil and waste rags must not be discarded randomly on the floor. Raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished goods must be neatly stacked, and blocking passageways is strictly prohibited. (15) Regularly maintain the cleanliness of lubrication and hydraulic systems. Keep the tank lid securely closed, ensuring no water, dust, metal chips, or other contaminants enter the oil tank or electrical equipment. (16) After finishing work and before leaving for the day, clean the machine tools and equipment thoroughly, ensuring they remain tidy. Return operating handles, buttons, and other controls to their non-working positions, turn off the power supply, and complete the handover procedures with the next shift. 3) Classification of Maintenance and Servicing Tasks Depending on the depth, scope, and volume of work involved in equipment maintenance and upkeep, maintenance tasks can be categorized into the following types. (1) Daily Maintenance (Routine Maintenance). Its main tasks include: inspecting and lubricating the equipment; strictly following the equipment operation procedures. Cheng uses the equipment to tighten any loose parts; cleans and wipes down the equipment, checks its operational status, and records the condition in the shift handover log. This type of maintenance is relatively simple, with most tasks performed on the equipment's surface. Daily maintenance should be carried out by the operating personnel. (2) First-Level Maintenance (Monthly Maintenance). The main tasks include: disassembling specified components such as the housing cover and protective shields, thoroughly cleaning and wiping both the inside and outside of the equipment; inspecting and adjusting clearance gaps between parts, tightening any loose components, and replacing individual wear-and-tear parts; clearing oil passages, cleaning filters, and replacing coolant while also flushing the coolant tank; cleaning guideways and sliding surfaces, removing burrs and scratches; and inspecting and adjusting electrical wiring and related devices. This first-level maintenance is performed after the equipment has been running for 1 to 2 months (under a two-shift system), primarily by operational staff with support from maintenance technicians. (3) Second-Level Maintenance (Annual Maintenance). In addition to the tasks included in first-level maintenance, second-level maintenance also involves repairing or replacing worn parts, adjusting clearances in components such as guides, maintaining the electrical system, and inspecting and fine-tuning equipment accuracy. This type of maintenance is carried out once a year after the equipment has been in operation, primarily by maintenance technicians with the participation of operators. 1.2.6 Equipment Fault Diagnosis Technology When equipment malfunctions, certain characteristics change accordingly, leading to variations in mechanical, thermal, acoustic, and electromagnetic physical and chemical parameters—each carrying distinct types of information. By capturing these altered indicators, detecting the underlying signals and patterns, and analyzing their causes and anomalies, fault diagnosis technology enables us to pinpoint the location, nature, and severity of the failure, as well as forecast future issues, assess damage conditions, make informed decisions, eliminate potential hazards, and ultimately prevent accidents from occurring. This is precisely what fault diagnosis technology aims to achieve. Mechatronic System Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance Case Studies Tutorial
If none of the above standards apply, refer to the equipment manufacturer's technical specifications. (4) Preparation of spare parts, materials, and specialized tools, inspection equipment, and research fixtures. The lead technical personnel should promptly provide the management team with detailed lists of replacement parts, material specifications, as well as lists of specialized tools, inspection equipment, and research fixtures, along with relevant drawings. After verifying the inventory, the management team will place orders or arrange for manufacturing to ensure that these items are available on time for use during major equipment overhauls. (5) Preparing the Overhaul Work Plan. The overhaul work plan is prepared by the planning personnel in the maintenance department, who are responsible for equipment management. Personnel, chief technicians, and maintenance foremen (team leaders) review it together. The overhaul work plan includes: work procedures, the number of workers required for each phase and stage of the job, along with the corresponding duration in days; requirements for seamless coordination between individual work phases; and details on projects that need to be outsourced to external partners, including specific timeframes. A general overhaul work plan can be presented using a ""bar chart"" format, supplemented by necessary explanatory text. For overhauls of complex, high-precision, large-scale, and critical equipment, network scheduling techniques should be employed to ensure efficient resource utilization, shorten project timelines, and enhance overall economic benefits. 4. Material Preparation Before Equipment Maintenance Material preparation before equipment maintenance is a critically important task, serving as the essential logistical foundation for successful repairs. In practice, delays often occur due to insufficient availability of spare parts and components, disrupting the normal flow of maintenance work, prolonging downtime, and ultimately leading to inefficiencies and production losses. Therefore, it is imperative to strengthen material preparation efforts prior to equipment maintenance. After the lead maintenance technician has prepared detailed lists of replacement parts and materials, they should promptly hand these over to the responsible personnel managing spare parts and supplies. Once the inventory has been verified, these managers will place orders accordingly. Meanwhile, after finalizing the repair procedures, the lead maintenance technician must immediately provide the tool management team with detailed lists and drawings of specialized tools, inspection devices, and testing equipment. The tool management staff will then cross-check the existing inventory and forward any necessary items—such as specialized tools, inspection devices, or testing equipment—to the relevant departments for evaluation. Based on the evaluation results, if repairs are indeed required, the departments will arrange for the necessary maintenance activities. Additionally, the tool management team will initiate new procurement requests for any additional specialized tools, inspection devices, or testing equipment that may be needed. 1.4.2 General Process for Mechanical Equipment Maintenance
1.5.1 The Significance of Equipment Management Strengthening equipment management and ensuring proper maintenance will keep machinery consistently in excellent condition, thereby extending its lifespan. This not only plays a critical role in boosting production volume and variety, enhancing labor productivity, reducing consumption, lowering costs, and safeguarding worker safety—but also significantly contributes to upgrading the company’s overall production technology, accelerating industrial growth, and protecting productive capacity. Equipment management is an extremely important task—only by effectively managing equipment can organizations achieve optimal economic results with minimal human, financial, and material resources. This, in turn, allows for the full realization of equipment potential, enabling businesses to better meet production goals. Especially in modern manufacturing, prioritizing sound equipment management is a fundamental principle that must be followed. Equipment maintenance management is an important component of enterprise management. Its primary tasks include: maximizing Effectively collecting and utilizing equipment information resources allows for the strategic management of manpower, materials, funds, equipment, and technology within the maintenance system, ensuring that maintenance operations achieve optimal quality and maximum efficiency. The key components of maintenance management include maintenance information management, maintenance planning, maintenance technology, process and quality control, spare parts management, and maintenance economic management. In modern enterprises, management is inseparable from technology, while the effective application of engineering technologies relies on sound management practices. Equipment engineering technicians, who are well-versed in equipment maintenance management principles and methods, should seamlessly integrate technical expertise with managerial skills. To this end, this section will outline the key aspects, methodologies, and practical applications of equipment maintenance management. 1.5.2 Information Management for Equipment Maintenance In corporate equipment maintenance activities, it is often necessary to make various technical and economic decisions, and the basis for these decisions is information. Breath. Without a systematic and reliable information system, effective management becomes difficult to implement. Therefore, the task of equipment maintenance information management is to establish a comprehensive information system that collects, stores, and organizes all types of equipment-related data, while also enabling data processing, output, and feedback—ultimately supporting informed economic and technical decision-making for equipment management. 1. Classification of Equipment Maintenance Information Equipment maintenance information can be complex, but it can generally be categorized using the following methods. 1) Categorized by equipment in the early versus later stages This classification method divides equipment information into two major systems—early-stage and later-stage—and further breaks them down into numerous subsystems. Within these subsystems, various types of equipment are grouped, ultimately leading to a detailed breakdown for each individual device. The approach is straightforward and clear, making it easy to process, organize, and access the information. 2) Categorized by equipment management objectives and performance indicators
(1) Basis for preparing the maintenance plan. ① The technical condition of equipment refers to its actual state in terms of technical performance, load capacity, transmission mechanisms, and operational safety. Key indicators reflecting the quality of a company’s equipment—including equipment integrity rate, failure downtime rate, and the extent to which equipment impacts balanced production—provide a clear picture of the overall technical condition. Information on equipment’s technical status is primarily gathered through comprehensive surveys and assessments of equipment conditions, as well as from original documentation. Typically, companies conduct equipment surveys during the third quarter of each year, with the main objective of identifying existing issues, proposing corrective measures, and completing the Equipment Technical Condition Survey Form, which then serves as the foundation for developing maintenance plans. Original records include daily inspections, routine checks, condition-monitoring logs, repair histories, and other primary documents, along with comprehensive analytical data. Equipment showing signs of deteriorating technical conditions and requiring maintenance should be included as items in the annual maintenance plan application. ② Requirements for equipment based on production processes and product quality. If the actual technical condition of the equipment fails to meet the process and quality standards for the product, the process department will submit a request to schedule planned maintenance."

2) Basis for preparing the maintenance plan, as well as considerations and key steps to be addressed.
3. Maintenance Work Plan Management When carrying out any specific equipment maintenance task, it is essential to develop a work plan. Utilizing network planning techniques to create these work plans optimizes job process management, ensures efficient use of all resources, shortens the repair timeline, and minimizes downtime-related losses. This approach is particularly suitable for major overhauls of large, complex equipment, as well as for planning project-based repairs and installation/adjustment projects involving such machinery. 4. Implementation of the Equipment Maintenance Plan Once the equipment maintenance plan is finalized, it must be strictly implemented to ensure its successful execution and strive to minimize downtime. Regular inspections of the plan's implementation are essential—these checks not only help maintain schedule adherence but also guarantee the quality of the repairs. After the maintenance work is completed, a joint inspection by relevant departments is mandatory. Each aspect of the equipment—such as precision and performance—must be thoroughly examined and verified against the established quality standards. Only when all criteria meet the repair quality benchmarks can we confidently ensure that production resumes smoothly. To minimize maintenance downtime and ensure the successful implementation of the plan, advanced maintenance organization methods can be employed depending on the specific situation. (2) The following issues should be considered when preparing the maintenance plan. ① Equipment critical to production needs, impacting product quality, and essential to key processes should be prioritized. ② Single critical equipment on the production line should, whenever possible, be scheduled for maintenance during holidays to minimize downtime. ③ Equipment for continuous or periodic production (thermal and power equipment) must be properly scheduled according to their specific characteristics, ensuring that equipment maintenance is closely integrated with production tasks. ④ Special requirements for precision equipment maintenance. ⑤ The balance of maintenance workload should be considered to ensure that repair activities are evenly distributed throughout the year. Prioritize and schedule maintenance tasks for equipment based on their urgency and importance. ⑥ The workload and timeline for pre-repair production technology preparation should be taken into account. ⑦ Arrange similar equipment continuously whenever possible. ⑧ Comprehensively consider the availability of technology, materials, labor, and funding sources required for equipment maintenance. (3) Preparation of the Annual Maintenance Plan. The five steps involved in compiling the annual maintenance plan are outlined below. ① Thoroughly assess the actual technical condition of the equipment requiring maintenance, and analyze the ease or difficulty of performing repairs.
⑤ Propose solutions to address the contradictions that have emerged in the above 4 steps. (4) Typically, the equipment maintenance plan for the following year is prepared in September each year. The preparation process follows these 4 steps: ① Gather information. Before drafting the plan, thorough data collection and analysis must be conducted. This primarily involves two key areas: first, technical condition data of the equipment, such as original documentation, equipment inspection forms, product process requirements, and quality-related information, to determine the appropriate maintenance category; and second, the annual production schedule, equipment maintenance quotas, relevant technical specifications for the equipment, and current inventory levels of spare parts. ② Prepare the draft. When drafting, fully consider how the annual production plan impacts equipment requirements, ensuring that maintenance schedules are aligned with production plans. This will help prevent both under-maintenance and over-maintenance of equipment. Before formally submitting the draft annual maintenance plan, the equipment management department, under the leadership of the chief plant manager, should organize a comprehensive technical and economic analysis and evaluation involving departments such as process engineering, technology, operations, and production—aiming to achieve well-balanced, rational objectives. ③ Balanced Approval. After the draft plan is completed, it is distributed to the production, planning, engineering, technical, finance, and user departments for discussion. Participants are invited to propose modifications, such as adding or removing items, adjusting maintenance downtime durations, setting machine-off delivery dates, and revising maintenance categories. Once these inputs are comprehensively evaluated and balanced, the final maintenance plan is formally prepared and submitted to senior management for approval. The maintenance plan must be filled out on the prescribed form, including details such as: the equipment’s basic information (user department, asset number, name, and model), the repair complexity factor, the type or scope of the repair work, time quotas, downtime duration, planned schedule, and the responsible maintenance contractor. Additionally, a plan description should be prepared, highlighting key priorities, identifying potential weak links, and outlining critical issues that need attention. Finally, preliminary measures and recommendations should be proposed to address these crucial challenges effectively. ④ Issue for execution. Before December each year, the enterprise's production planning department will issue the equipment maintenance plan for the following year, serving as the basis for the company's operations."

Component Repair Method By treating equipment components as the primary focus of maintenance—replacing entire components during repairs—the process allows for disassembly, reassembly of parts, and even manufacturing tasks to be carried out after the component has been replaced. This approach significantly reduces downtime during maintenance. However, the component-based repair method requires maintaining a certain inventory of spare parts, which ties up some working capital. For companies that own large numbers of similar equipment, this method is particularly well-suited. Component Repair Method Some machinery and equipment experience heavy production loads, making it difficult to schedule ample time for major overhauls. In such cases, the sectional maintenance method can be employed. This approach involves repairing different components of the equipment at separate times—rather than all at once—by systematically and sequentially addressing each independent part of the machine, focusing on just one section at a time. The key advantage of sectional maintenance is that it allows organizations to take advantage of holidays Repairs are carried out during non-production hours to maximize machine uptime and improve equipment utilization. The sectional repair method is suitable for machinery with structurally independent components, as well as equipment requiring lengthy maintenance periods—such as modular machine tools and heavy-duty transportation equipment. 1.4.6 Methods for Repairing Mechanical Parts 1. Repair Dimension Method For certain mating dimensions, wear and other factors can alter the nature of the fit, leading to component failure. In such cases, cutting processes or other methods can be employed to restore the shape accuracy, positional accuracy, surface roughness, and other technical specifications of the worn areas on the primary part. Meanwhile, the complementary, simpler component—whether a new part manufactured to the correct dimensions while maintaining its original fit characteristics, or a repaired version—is produced accordingly. The dimension obtained after this reconditioning process is referred to as the ""repair size."" This approach is economically advantageous and ensures consistent quality since it involves machining directly on the existing component. However, it does reduce the strength and rigidity of the part, and it also necessitates replacing or repairing the mating component, thereby complicating the interchangeability of parts. The repair dimensioning method is primarily used to restore parts with relatively complex structures, while the corresponding complementary part is typically simpler—such as journal bearings, transmission threads, keyways, or sliding guides. 6. Weld Repair Method The process of welding—where two or more materials (either identical or different) are joined permanently by heating, applying pressure, or combining both methods to achieve atomic-level bonding—is known as welding. At its core, this technique involves repairing damaged parts such as those with cracks or fractures, as well as building up wear-resistant and corrosion-resistant weld layers onto the surfaces of failed components. Its primary purpose is to restore most metal parts that have suffered damage due to wear, breakage, cracking, pitting, or other forms of deterioration. The advantages of the welding repair method include high bonding strength, simple welding equipment, mature technology, no limitations on part size, low cost, high efficiency, and great flexibility. The downside is that, due to the high welding temperature, it can easily cause changes in the microstructure, leading to stress and deformation. Additionally, it’s not suitable for repairing parts that require high precision, are slender, or relatively thin, as these components are prone to defects such as porosity, slag inclusion, and cracking."

③ Having well-equipped maintenance facilities organized according to functional divisions and strategically located for optimal efficiency. The main drawback of the planned preventive maintenance system is its poor cost-effectiveness. With fixed maintenance cycles and scopes, it often leads to unnecessary repairs of certain components—what’s known as over-maintenance. During the maintenance process, repairs are categorized into several levels and types based on the depth and breadth of the work required, including major overhauls, mid-level repairs, minor repairs, item-specific repairs, retrofits, and unplanned maintenance tasks—all determined by the scale and nature of the repair workload. (1) Overhaul: A comprehensive or fundamental restoration of the functionality of mechanical and electrical equipment, typically carried out by specialized maintenance teams within factories and mines —or at repair centers established in regions with a high concentration of industrial facilities. During an overhaul, the equipment is either fully or extensively disassembled, with  a focus on repairing critical components, replacing or refurbishing parts that have lost their function or are on the verge of doing so. After the repairs, the equipment’s precision is restored to nearly its original factory specifications, while also receiving a fresh cosmetic overhaul to enhance its appearance. (2) Intermediate Overhaul. This is a level of maintenance that falls between major and minor overhauls, serving as a balanced approach to upkeep. (3) Minor Repair. This involves replacing or repairing components that have significantly worn out or are nearing failure within the maintenance interval, without addressing any underlying structural issues. It is a troubleshooting-based repair aimed at restoring functionality. The three levels—major overhaul, mid-term repair, and minor repair—objectively reflect the chronological progression of机电 equipment, making them ideally suited  for implementing time-based planned preventive maintenance, a practice widely adopted by most organizations. However, these levels still require complementary repair tiers to address unforeseen maintenance needs effectively. (4) Item-based maintenance. Based on condition monitoring of mechanical and electrical equipment, this involves proactively planning repairs specifically for components or technical items that are about to fail. Item-based maintenance is conducted between major, medium, and minor overhauls—it’s a non-periodic, planned maintenance level that doesn’t follow a fixed cycle. (5) Retrofitting. This involves making localized modifications to existing mechanical and electrical equipment using new  technologies, materials, structures, and processes, with the goal of enhancing its precision, functionality, productivity, and reliability. Such repairs are classified as improvement-oriented, and the extent of the work required depends on how well the original equipment’s design accommodates the retrofitting process—as well as on the specific level of performance enhancement desired for the equipment. Retrofitting is also referred to as modernization or upgrading. (6) Unscheduled Maintenance. This is a level of maintenance required for mechanical and electrical equipment due to sudden breakdowns and accidents. The fewer the number and scope of unscheduled maintenance activities, the higher the level of management.
1.4.1 Preparations Before Mechanical Equipment Maintenance Electromechanical equipment occupies a critically important position in the production and operational activities of modern industrial enterprises. To ensure smooth equipment operation and safe production, implementing planned preventive maintenance is an essential component of equipment management and repair practices in industrial companies. This section will cover the detailed process of major equipment overhauls, the determination of equipment repair plans, as well as the technical and material preparations required prior to equipment maintenance. 1. Equipment Major Overhaul Process To ensure the precision and operational performance of mechanical and electrical equipment, preventive scheduled maintenance must be carried out in addition to routine upkeep. Among these preventive measures, major overhauls stand out as a critical task aimed at restoring the equipment's accuracy. Within the category of preventive maintenance, major overhauls—often referred to simply as ""overhauls""—represent the most extensive and time-consuming type of repair. An overhaul involves completely or largely disassembling the equipment, repairing or replacing foundational components, refurbishing mechanical and electrical parts, recalibrating the electrical systems, and finally reassembling and fine-tuning the entire unit. The ultimate goal is to thoroughly eliminate any pre-existing defects and restore the equipment to its specified performance standards. The purpose of precision and performance. The major steps involved in the overhaul of mechanical and electrical equipment typically include: pre-disassembly unit inspection, component removal, component inspection, necessary component disassembly, parts cleaning and examination, component repair and assembly, final assembly, no-load trial operation, load testing, overall machine precision verification, and final acceptance. In practice, these tasks should be carried out according to the overhaul work plan, while also ensuring effective job scheduling, quality control during operations, and thorough completion acceptance. The major overhaul process for mechanical and electrical equipment is typically divided into three stages: pre-repair preparation, the repair process itself, and post-repair acceptance. Pre-repair preparation phase To ensure the repair work proceeds smoothly and accurately, maintenance personnel should carefully listen to operators' requirements for equipment repairs and thoroughly understand the issues affecting the equipment being serviced—such as loss of precision, the extent of wear on major mechanical components, the accuracy of the transmission system, and any visible defects. They should also identify which parts need improvement or modification to meet the equipment’s operational specifications. Additionally, they should review relevant technical documentation, equipment manuals, and previous maintenance records to become familiar with the device’s structural features, transmission system, and original design precision standards. This preparation will enable them to propose comprehensive pre-inspection tasks. Following the pre-inspection, specific repair methods for critical and large components can be determined, allowing for the preparation of specialized tools and precision measuring instruments. Finally, the team must define the post-repair precision testing procedures and establish clear acceptance criteria for trial runs, ensuring all technical preparations are fully in place before proceeding with the complete overhaul of the equipment.
If none of the above standards apply, refer to the equipment manufacturer's technical specifications. (4) Preparation of spare parts, materials, and specialized tools, inspection equipment, and research fixtures. The lead technical personnel should promptly provide the management team with detailed lists of replacement parts, material specifications, as well as lists of specialized tools, inspection equipment, and research fixtures, along with relevant drawings. After verifying the inventory, the management team will place orders or arrange for manufacturing to ensure that these items are available on time for use during major equipment overhauls. (5) Preparing  the Overhaul Work Plan. The overhaul work plan is prepared by the planning personnel in the maintenance department, who are responsible for equipment management. Personnel, chief technicians, and maintenance foremen (team leaders) review it together. The overhaul work plan includes: work procedures, the number of workers required for each phase and stage of  the job, along with the corresponding duration in days; requirements for seamless coordination between individual work phases; and details on projects that need to be outsourced to  external partners, including specific timeframes. A general overhaul work plan can be presented using a ""bar chart"" format, supplemented by necessary explanatory text. For overhauls of complex, high-precision, large-scale, and critical equipment, network scheduling techniques should be employed to ensure efficient resource utilization, shorten project timelines, and enhance overall economic benefits. 4. Material Preparation Before Equipment Maintenance Material preparation before equipment maintenance is a critically important task, serving as the essential logistical foundation for successful repairs. In practice, delays often occur due to insufficient availability of spare parts and components, disrupting the normal flow of maintenance work, prolonging downtime, and ultimately leading to inefficiencies and production losses. Therefore, it is imperative to strengthen material preparation efforts prior to equipment maintenance. After the lead maintenance technician has prepared detailed lists of replacement parts and materials, they should promptly hand these over to the responsible personnel managing spare parts and supplies. Once the inventory has been verified, these managers will place orders accordingly. Meanwhile, after finalizing the repair procedures, the lead maintenance technician must immediately provide the tool management team with detailed lists and drawings of specialized tools, inspection devices, and testing equipment. The tool management staff will then cross-check the existing inventory and forward any necessary items—such as specialized tools, inspection devices, or testing equipment—to the relevant departments for evaluation. Based on the evaluation results, if repairs are indeed required, the departments will arrange for the necessary maintenance activities. Additionally, the tool management team will initiate new procurement requests for any additional specialized tools, inspection devices, or testing equipment that may be needed. 1.4.2 General Process for Mechanical Equipment Maintenance"

Context:  
Equipment maintenance technology and process management refer to the scientific administration of all technical and operational activities involved in the maintenance system and the repair process. Equipment maintenance quality management involves a series of managerial practices aimed at ensuring the high quality of equipment repairs. These three areas of management play a crucial role in successfully completing equipment maintenance tasks. Management of Basic Maintenance Technical Tasks
3. Reliability Maintenance Also known as Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM), this approach emerged in the U.S. civil aviation industry during the 1960s and is now widely implemented in industries with particularly high demands for equipment operational reliability, such as the nuclear and military sectors. While the time it takes for a potential failure in operating equipment to evolve into a functional failure can vary, all failure patterns eventually reveal detectable trends through systematic monitoring. This technique leverages these predictable patterns to implement proactive maintenance measures—making it a reliability-focused maintenance strategy aimed at enhancing equipment dependability. Rooted in reliability theory, RCM involves detailed analysis and experimentation of factors influencing system reliability, followed by the application of logical decision-making processes. This approach enables the scientific development of tailored maintenance plans, the optimal selection of repair methods, and the precise determination of equipment lifespan—all designed to maintain and restore the inherent reliability of assets while minimizing costs.

3. Reliability Maintenance Also known as Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM), this approach emerged in the U.S. civil aviation industry during the 1960s and is now widely implemented in industries with particularly high demands for equipment operational reliability, such as the nuclear and military sectors. While the time it takes for a potential failure in operating equipment to evolve into a functional failure can vary, all failure patterns eventually reveal detectable trends through systematic monitoring. This technique leverages these predictable patterns to implement proactive maintenance measures—making it a reliability-focused maintenance strategy aimed at enhancing equipment dependability. Rooted in reliability theory, RCM involves detailed analysis and experimentation of factors influencing system reliability, followed by the application of logical decision-making processes. This approach enables the scientific development of tailored maintenance plans, the optimal selection of repair methods, and the precise determination of equipment lifespan—all designed to maintain and restore the inherent reliability of assets while minimizing costs.

The management process should encompass the entire lifecycle of the materials—covering collection, organization, evaluation, classification, numbering, reproduction (such as drafting), storage, retrieval, and distribution. Effective management of technical documentation requires prioritization: key equipment manuals, along with relevant assembly drawings, electrical schematics, and other critical documents, should be clearly marked for enhanced oversight. Importantly, these priority documents are typically not available for external loan. To facilitate compilation and retrieval, it is necessary to establish a coded indexing system for the data and implement computer-based management. The equipment maintenance manual serves as a comprehensive collection of specialized technical documentation for equipment repair, providing maintenance personnel with essential resources for troubleshooting, diagnosing faults, developing repair strategies, and even manufacturing spare parts when needed. The equipment maintenance manuals are compiled separately for each equipment model, and the manuals should include the following content. (1) Features and Feature Diagrams. The features and feature diagrams include an outline diagram, lifting diagram, installation foundation drawing, and Chapter 1—Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance. 51
29 Record the measured values. (4) Check the machine tool's operational condition: Verify whether the control system responds sensitively and reliably during movement; ensure that all movements meet the specified values; and confirm that the motion is smooth, without vibrations, noise, or stick-slip phenomena. (5) Inspect the machine tool guideways, lead screws, and racks for wear, and measure the extent of the wear. (6) Inspect the hydraulic, pneumatic, and lubrication systems: Verify that movements are accurate, check for any component damage or leaks, and if leaks are present, identify the cause. (7) Inspect the electrical system: Check whether electrical components are aged or malfunctioning. (8) Inspect safety protection devices: Verify that all limit switches and interlock mechanisms are sensitive and reliable, and check whether any of the indicator instruments or protective guards are damaged. (9) Inspect the equipment's appearance and accessories: Check for chipped paint, damage to any handles, ensure all labels are present, and verify that accessories are complete and free from wear or damage. (10) Partial disassembly inspection to determine whether parts need replacement or repair based on their wear condition. During the pre-inspection, especially large and complex castings and forgings, high-precision critical components, and purchased parts must be checked one by one to determine whether they need replacement or repair. Preparing overhaul technical documentation By conducting a pre-inspection to assess the equipment's condition and determine whether repairs or component replacements are necessary, we can then proceed to analyze, develop a repair plan, and prepare the corresponding technical documentation. These technical documents serve as the foundation for major equipment overhauls. Commonly used technical documents for equipment overhauls include the following types: (1) Prepare the equipment maintenance technical specification. The equipment maintenance technical specification should include the following content. ① The technical condition of the equipment before major overhaul. ② Key maintenance activities include detailing the disassembly, cleaning, and inspection of components to identify parts that require repair or replacement; briefly outlining the repair methods for basic and critical components; specifying mechanisms that must be thoroughly inspected and adjusted, as well as other areas requiring attention; and highlighting specific parts and aspects that can be improved during the overhaul process. ③ Maintenance quality requirements: Specify the names and numbers of the general technical standards applicable to each quality inspection during major equipment overhauls, and attach the content of any specialized technical standards to the back of the task specification. (2) Preparing Maintenance Procedures. The maintenance procedures for mechanical equipment are the technical documents that must be carefully followed and implemented during major overhauls. When developing overhaul procedures, it’s essential to consider the actual conditions, ensuring both technical feasibility and economic viability. Mechanical equipment overhaul procedures can be categorized into two types: standard maintenance procedures and specialized maintenance procedures. The overhaul procedures for mechanical equipment typically include the following elements. ① Disassembly procedures and methods for the complete machine and its components, as well as the data to be monitored and precautions to observe during the disassembly process.
6 The procedure for equipment failure management is outlined below. (1) Conduct thorough education and awareness campaigns to ensure that operators and maintenance personnel voluntarily comply with relevant rules and regulations regarding operation, maintenance, inspection, etc., properly use and carefully maintain equipment, and diligently record, compile statistics, and analyze any equipment malfunctions. (2) Based on the company’s actual production conditions, equipment status, and specific features, determine the key areas for equipment failure management. (3) Use monitoring instruments and diagnostic techniques to systematically monitor critical equipment, enabling timely detection of fault indicators and deterioration. Information on equipment condition. Typically, equipment can undergo daily inspections, routine patrols, and periodic checks (including precision assessments), as well as integrity assessments—using human senses and common diagnostic tools—to closely monitor the technical status and any unusual signs in components, mechanisms, and areas prone to failure. At the same time, inspection standards should be established to clearly define the boundaries between normal operation, abnormalities, and equipment failures. (4) To quickly locate the fault location and its cause, in addition to providing training to ensure that maintenance and operational staff acquire a solid understanding of electrical and hydraulic technologies, it is also essential to compile common equipment failure symptoms, analysis procedures, and troubleshooting methods into a fault-finding logic flowchart. This will enable operators to swiftly identify the source and root cause of any malfunction after it occurs, allowing for timely diagnosis, repair, and restoration of equipment functionality. (5) Improve the fault recording system. Fault records serve as the foundational data for effective fault management and also provide the original basis for conducting fault analysis and troubleshooting. Records must be complete and accurate. After on-site inspections and fault repairs, maintenance personnel should follow the ""Equipment Carefully complete the ""Equipment Failure Repair Form"" and submit monthly statistical analyses to the equipment management department. (6) Conduct timely statistics and analysis of equipment failures. In addition to monitoring failure situations on a daily basis, staff members should compile ""Failure Repair Forms"" and maintenance records on a monthly basis. By systematically collecting, organizing, and analyzing failure data, it’s possible to calculate the failure frequency and mean time between failures for each type of equipment. Furthermore, this process allows for an in-depth analysis of individual equipment failure trends and identifies key root causes, helping to pinpoint recurring patterns. Armed with this insight, teams can prioritize their response strategies effectively. Finally, the compiled and analyzed failure information should be shared back with the planning department, enabling them to schedule preventive maintenance or implement improvement measures. This data can also serve as a valuable reference for adjusting the intervals, content, and standards of routine inspections. (7) Implement different countermeasures based on the nature of the failure, the type of fault, and the specific characteristics of the equipment. For newly acquired equipment, strengthen management during the initial phase of use—carefully monitor and document the equipment’s precision, performance, and any emerging defects from the outset. During operation, emphasize routine maintenance, regular patrol inspections, and periodic checks to promptly identify early warning signs and take appropriate adjustment or troubleshooting actions. For critical equipment, conduct condition monitoring and diagnostics. Establish a flexible and responsive maintenance team equipped with advanced technical expertise, employing rapid repair techniques such as component-by-component fixes or group-based replacements. Ensure timely availability of high-quality spare parts, leverage production downtime for equipment overhauls, and apply measures like retrofitting or replacing components when wear patterns have been thoroughly understood. (8) Carry out routine maintenance tasks effectively to control equipment failures. Utilize status information and early warning signs of potential issues gathered during daily rounds by regional maintenance workers, as well as scheduled equipment condition checks, along with relevant records and analysis data. Based on the specific characteristics of each type of equipment and the general defects already identified, the workshop’s equipment mechanic (technician) or maintenance team leader should promptly schedule routine repairs—ideally during production downtime or weekend slots—to proactively address problems before they escalate, thereby minimizing breakdowns. For certain failure indicators or hidden risks that exceed the scope of routine maintenance, these should be reported back to the planning department for scheduling dedicated, planned maintenance activities instead. (9) Establish a rational fault information management flowchart.
Transmission system diagram, hydraulic system diagram, electrical systems and wiring diagrams, rolling bearing location maps, and lubrication system diagrams, among others. (2) Assembly drawings. Manufacturers typically do not provide complete assembly drawings for components, subassemblies, and the finished machine. Whenever possible, you should gather these drawings or, during equipment maintenance, create detailed sketches of critical components or the entire machine. (3) Spare parts, wear-and-tear component drawings and bills of materials, along with a list of purchased components. (4) Other content. For power equipment, as-built drawings, piping or wiring network diagrams, and similar documents should also be provided. 3) Maintenance Technical Preparation Work Technical preparation work before equipment maintenance is also an important foundational task, primarily involving a pre-maintenance technical condition assessment and the preparation of maintenance-related technical documents. 2. Standardization of Maintenance Procedures To ensure repair quality, enhance repair efficiency, and prevent resource waste, it is necessary to standardize the various procedural practices involved in the repair process. 1) Maintenance Procedures (1) Typical maintenance procedures. A typical maintenance procedure refers to the repair process developed for common wear-and-tear scenarios affecting parts of a specific equipment type and structural design—parts that are identical across such equipment. While these procedures offer broad guidance, they often lack specificity when applied to a particular piece of equipment. (2) Dedicated maintenance procedures. Dedicated maintenance procedures refer to processes specifically developed by a company for a particular model of equipment, tailored to address its actual wear-and-tear conditions. Moreover, the maintenance procedure prepared for a specific repair of this equipment still holds significant reference value for future repairs and should be adjusted and updated as needed, based on actual wear conditions and technological advancements.
(1) Basis for preparing the maintenance plan. ① The technical condition of equipment refers to its actual state in terms of technical performance, load capacity, transmission mechanisms, and operational safety. Key indicators reflecting the quality of a company’s equipment—including equipment integrity rate, failure downtime rate, and the extent to which equipment impacts balanced production—provide a clear picture of the overall technical condition. Information on equipment’s technical status is primarily gathered through comprehensive surveys and assessments of equipment conditions, as well as from original documentation. Typically, companies conduct equipment surveys during the third quarter of each year, with the main objective of identifying existing issues, proposing corrective measures, and completing the Equipment Technical Condition Survey Form, which then serves as the foundation for developing maintenance plans. Original records include daily inspections, routine checks, condition-monitoring logs, repair histories, and other primary documents, along with comprehensive analytical data. Equipment showing signs of deteriorating technical conditions and requiring maintenance should be included as items in the annual maintenance plan application. ② Requirements for equipment based on production processes and product quality. If the actual technical condition of the equipment fails to meet the process and quality standards for the product, the process department will submit a request to schedule planned maintenance."

(9) Inspect the equipment's appearance and accessories: Check for chipped paint, damage to any handles, ensure all labels are present, and verify that accessories are complete and free from wear or damage. (10) Partial disassembly inspection to determine whether parts need replacement or repair based on their wear condition. During the pre-inspection, especially large and complex castings and forgings, high-precision critical components, and purchased parts must be checked one by one to determine whether they need replacement or repair. Preparing overhaul technical documentation By conducting a pre-inspection to assess the equipment's condition and determine whether repairs or component replacements are necessary, we can then proceed to analyze, develop a repair plan, and prepare the corresponding technical documentation. These technical documents serve as the foundation for major equipment overhauls. Commonly used technical documents for equipment overhauls include the following types: (1) Prepare the equipment maintenance technical specification. The equipment maintenance technical specification should include the following content. ① The technical condition of the equipment before major overhaul. ② Key maintenance activities include detailing the disassembly, cleaning, and inspection of components to identify parts that require repair or replacement; briefly outlining the r epair methods for basic and critical components; specifying mechanisms that must be thoroughly inspected and adjusted, as well as other areas requiring attention; and highlighting  specific parts and aspects that can be improved during the overhaul process. ③ Maintenance quality requirements: Specify the names and numbers of the general technical standards ap plicable to each quality inspection during major equipment overhauls, and attach the content of any specialized technical standards to the back of the task specification. (2) Prepa ring Maintenance Procedures. The maintenance procedures for mechanical equipment are the technical documents that must be carefully followed and implemented during major overhauls.  When developing overhaul procedures, it’s essential to consider the actual conditions, ensuring both technical feasibility and economic viability. Mechanical equipment overhaul pr ocedures can be categorized into two types: standard maintenance procedures and specialized maintenance procedures. The overhaul procedures for mechanical equipment typically inclu de the following elements. ① Disassembly procedures and methods for the complete machine and its components, as well as the data to be monitored and precautions to observe during t he disassembly process.
Transmission system diagram, hydraulic system diagram, electrical systems and wiring diagrams, rolling bearing location maps, and lubrication system diagrams, among others. (2) Assembly drawings.

2) Key Points for Process Specification Work (1) Disassembly process. When repairing mechanical equipment, the first step is to partially disassemble and take it apart. However, each time a machine is disassembled, its perfor mance and precision inevitably suffer some degree of damage. Improper disassembly of precision equipment can even lead to complete报废 of the device. Therefore, it is crucial to appr oach this process with utmost care and expertise. Key and precision equipment should have dismantling process specifications developed. The general principles and precautions for d isassembly will be introduced in Chapter 2 and can serve as a reference when developing the disassembly process. Additionally, please keep the following points in mind. ① Safety co mes first during disassembly. Before starting, ensure the power supply is disconnected, remove any hazardous materials—such as toxic or flammable substances—from both inside and ou tside the machinery and equipment, set up reliable supports, and select appropriate lifting equipment and tools. ② Disassembly for service and maintenance. Do not disassemble compo nents that are unnecessary or prohibited. For parts with tight fits, establish a proper disassembly method and use appropriate tools to avoid damaging critical surfaces. ③ Disassem bly serves assembly.

The cleaning process should include details such as the cleaning method, cleaning procedu re, type or formulation of the cleaning agent, cleaning parameters, cleaning quality, and important precautions during cleaning. (3) Repair Processes for Typical Components. In equ ipment maintenance, certain critical parts—such as machine beds, housings, worktables, and large rotating components—often require restoration. To ensure effective repairs and enha nce overall efficiency, it’s essential to select the appropriate repair solution and develop a detailed maintenance process procedure. These procedures are typically documented in  the form of process cards, which provide more specifics than standard manufacturing process cards yet remain simpler than operation-specific cards. A typical maintenance process ca rd usually includes the following information: ① Part name, drawing number, material and properties, part defect indication diagram, and explanations regarding the defects.
1.4.3 General Principles and Requirements for Mechanical Equipment Disassembly Any piece of machine ry is assembled from numerous components. When machinery requires maintenance, it must first be disassembled so that faulty parts can be repaired or replaced. The primary purpose o f dismantling machinery is to facilitate the inspection and repair of its components; in fact, the disassembly process typically accounts for about 20% of the total maintenance wor kload. Therefore, to ensure high-quality repairs, it’s essential to carefully plan ahead and anticipate potential challenges before starting to take apart the equipment. This way,  the dismantling can proceed methodically—following a structured approach that adheres to the following rules and guidelines. Preparations Before Disassembly (1) Selection and Cleanup of the Disassembly Site. Before disassembly, choose an appropriate work area—avoid locations prone to windblown sand or dust. The workspace should be kept free from frequent unauthorized access by unrelated personnel to prevent unnecessary disruptions or accidents. Additionally, ensure that the ground in the work area remains clean, free from dirt, oil, or other contaminants. Prior to entering the disassembly site, all machinery must undergo an external cleaning process to guarantee that the disassembly procedure does not compromise the equipment’s precision. (2) Protective Measures: Before cleaning the exterior of mechanical equipment, electrical devices should be either removed or properly protected to prevent moisture damage. Additionally, parts prone to oxidation and rust should promptly undergo appropriate protective and maintenance measures. (3) Draining the oil before disassembly. Whenever possible, drain the lubricating oil from the machinery while it’s still hot prior to disassembly, ensuring smoother and more efficient removal work. (4) Understand the structure, performance, and operating principles of mechanical equipment. To avoid unnecessary disassembly and ensure the smooth progress of maintenance work, thoroughly assess all aspects of the machinery before dismantling. Familiarize yourself with the structural features of each component, the transmission system, as well as the specific design characteristics and interrelationships of individual parts. Clearly identify their intended functions and how they interact with one another, enabling you to plan the disassembly process logically and select the appropriate tools or equipment for the job. Mechatronics System Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance Case Study Tutorial
General Principles for Disassembly (1) Based on the structural characteristics of the mechanical equipment, select a logical disassembly sequence. Typically, the process involves dismantling from the overall unit into subassemblies, then breaking down subassemblies into individual components, and finally separating components into their constituent parts—or alternatively, proceeding from accessories to the main unit and from external elements inward. When disassembling particularly complex components, it’s essential to thoroughly study the assembly drawings and carefully analyze the component’s structure as well as the specific roles its parts play within the assembly. Pay special attention to components that require high precision during assembly. This approach helps prevent confusion, ensures an orderly disassembly process, and ultimately facilitates cleaning, inspection, and identification—laying a solid foundation for effective maintenance work. (2) Rational disassembly. During the maintenance and disassembly of mechanical equipment, adhere to the principle of avoiding unnecessary disassembly while ensuring that components requiring removal are indeed taken apart. (3) Use disassembly tools and equipment correctly. After understanding the steps involved in removing mechanical components, it’s crucial to select and properly apply the appropriate disassembly tools. When dismantling, always opt for specialized or suitably matched tools and equipment whenever possible, avoiding random hammering or forceful techniques to prevent damage or deformation of the parts. For instance, when removing shaft sleeves, rolling bearings, gears, pulleys, and similar components, use pullers or hydraulic presses; and for unscrewing studs or nuts, always prefer wrenches that match their dimensions precisely. Precautions During Disassembly: When performing mechanical equipment maintenance, disassembly should also take into account the subsequent assembly tasks. To ensure a smooth process, keep the following points in mind. (1) Ensure thorough verification or marking of disassembled parts. Mechanical equipment often contains numerous precisely matched components and parts, many of which have been specifically selected or balanced for weight—meaning their assembly positions and orientations must not be altered under any circumstances. Therefore, when dismantling, carefully check parts that already bear original markings. If these markings are unclear, misaligned, or missing altogether, re-mark them exactly as they were originally to ensure proper alignment during reassembly, preventing any confusion or errors. (2) Store parts by category. When storing disassembled parts, follow these principles: Parts belonging to the same type or component should be kept together whenever possible; store items according to their size and precision level; non-interchangeable parts must be stored separately in groups; delicate components that are sensitive to dirt or damage should be removed and stored individually; rubber parts should never be stored alongside oil-bearing components; and ensure that easily lost items are carefully accounted for. Parts such as washers and nuts should be strung together with wire or stored in dedicated containers; all types of studs must be fitted with nuts before being placed in storage. Additionally, parts like steel components, aluminum items, rubber pieces, and leather goods should be stored separately in different containers, categorized by their respective material types. (3) Protect the machined surfaces of removed parts. During disassembly, never damage the machined surfaces of the components being taken apart—doing so could complicate repair work and lead to issues such as air, oil, or water leaks, ultimately resulting in reduced performance of the mechanical equipment. 1.4.4 Disassembly Methods for Commonly Used Components The disassembly of commonly used components should follow general disassembly principles, while also considering their specific characteristics and employing appropriate methods tailored to each component in order to achieve the intended purpose. 1. Disassembly of the Spindle Assembly To prevent reduced assembly accuracy due to improper disassembly, mark the relative positions of bearings, washers, tool housings, and spindles around the circumference during removal. After disassembling, group each bearing along with its corresponding inner and outer washers separately and store them in distinct locations—do not mix them up. Ensure that the workbench and surrounding area at the disassembly site remain clean, and immediately place all removed parts into oil to prevent rusting. When reassembling, be sure to reinstall them according to their original marked orientations."

Material details, etc. 6. Maintenance-Free Design Maintenance-free design is the ideal goal for equipment maintenance—it refers to implementing improvement measures during the design phase of new machinery and electrical equipment to address common failures encountered during maintenance, aiming to minimize maintenance efforts or even eliminate the need for repairs altogether. 1.2.2 Maintenance Method Selection The purpose of maintenance is to ensure the reliable operation of equipment—specifically, to guarantee the dependable fulfillment of its intended use—and, at the same time, minimize maintenance costs. Therefore, the fundamental requirements for maintenance decisions are: ① Reliability must not fall below the permissible minimum value [R], meaning that ()[] R ≥ R(t); ② Maintenance costs (KI) must be kept as low as possible—or, alternatively, must not exceed a predetermined maintenance cost limit (KImin), i.e., K ≤ KImin. To optimize maintenance decisions, the first step should be to choose an appropriate maintenance approach. The six maintenance methods mentioned above each have a specific scope of applicability; however, their effectiveness can vary depending on how appropriately they are applied. To maximize equipment efficiency, minimize downtime-related losses, and reduce maintenance costs, it’s essential to select the most suitable approach based on the characteristics of mechatronic systems and the conditions under which they are used. Looking ahead, the trend in maintenance practices is shifting from routine preventive maintenance toward planned, periodic inspections—and then, based on inspection findings, scheduling timely condition-based repairs. As the technological sophistication of factory equipment continues to rise, with increasingly complex system designs and broader adoption of mechatronic solutions, production activities are becoming more reliant on equipment performance and reliability. Consequently, the traditional static approach to maintenance management is evolving into a more dynamic model, gradually moving toward advanced strategies such as reliability-centered maintenance and quality-focused repair practices. Mechatronic equipment comes in a wide variety of types and is widely applied, making it essential to select one or a combination of maintenance methods tailored to the specific situation. When choosing a maintenance approach for mechatronic systems, reliability typically becomes the primary focus. For critical components, implementing condition-based monitoring allows for timely preventive measures. Meanwhile, for equipment at quality control points, it’s crucial to closely track changes in product quality during the manufacturing process and promptly address any detected anomalies through quality repairs. Additionally, it’s important to equip teams with personnel who are well-versed in microelectronics technology, providing them with supervision and guidance while fostering the development of skilled, integrated mechatronics technicians. Regular inspections and logical fault analysis should be conducted on CNC and other mechatronic systems, and any failed components identified must be promptly replaced and properly adjusted to ensure optimal performance. 1.2.3 Maintenance System Maintenance work is not only a technical task but also a managerial one. A maintenance system refers to a set of guidelines established under specific maintenance theories and principles, encompassing elements such as maintenance plans, categories, methods, timing, scope, levels, organizational structures, and performance evaluation metrics. Implementing a rational maintenance system helps optimize the allocation of human, material, and financial resources, enabling timely preparation before maintenance tasks, ensuring repairs are carried out appropriately, meeting operational requirements, enhancing the technical condition, reliability, and service life of机电 equipment, reducing downtime, and minimizing maintenance costs and production losses due to equipment shutdowns. Meanwhile, maintenance systems are continuously evolving and improving—currently, the main approaches include the following: Planned Preventive Maintenance System It is based on a thorough understanding of the wear and failure patterns of mechanical and electrical equipment, applying the principle of pre vention being better than cure—and addressing potential issues before they escalate—by systematically organizing maintenance and repairs according to the rate of wear and expected  service life of each component. This approach helps prevent premature wear, compensates for natural degradation, minimizes or avoids failures altogether, extends equipment lifespan , and ultimately saves time spent on repairs, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and boosting economic returns. The practical implementation of planned preventive maintenance  can be summarized as  ""regular inspections, timely upkeep, and scheduled repairs, "" making it particularly suitable for Chapter 1 of this guide: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment. 11 Macro-level management. I mplementing a planned preventive maintenance system requires the following conditions: ① Determining the maintenance intervals for assemblies and key components through statistical analysis, measurements, and experimental studies, and rationally categorizing mainten ance tasks;
2) Maintenance Process Stage Once the maintenance process begins, the first step is to disassemble the equipment—following a sequence and approach that reverses the original assembly order, adhering to the principle of ""top-down and outside-in."" This systematic method carefully releases the components from their interlocking and fixed positions within the machine. After removal, each part should undergo a secondary pre-inspection. Based on the findings from this second check, any additional repair parts required will be identified. Furthermore, the availability of replacement and repaired components, along with their current status, will help establish a rough schedule for the maintenance tasks. This ensures that the repair work progresses methodically and according to plan, preventing delays caused by poor coordination in organizational efforts. The precision and performance achievable during equipment maintenance depend on factors such as the technical expertise available for repair work, the number of major overhauls the equipment has undergone, and its pre-repair technical condition. Generally speaking, for machinery undergoing its first major overhaul, both its precision and performance should ideally meet the original factory standards. However, after two or more major overhauls, the equipment’s post-repair precision and performance typically fall short of those of a new unit. That said, if the equipment was in relatively good technical condition prior to the last overhaul, it will likely be easier to restore its quality closer to the original factory standards this time around. Conversely, if the previous overhaul left the equipment in suboptimal condition, it may create significant challenges for the next major repair—and in some cases, the resulting quality might even fail to meet the original factory standards, making further repairs impractical altogether. The assembly of the complete equipment is carried out according to acceptance criteria. During assembly, appropriate reference surfaces should be selected for accurate mechanical and electrical system fault diagnosis and maintenance case studies.
Disassembly of the Gear Pair To improve the precision of the transmission chain, the gear pair with a transmission ratio of 1 is assembled using an error-compensation method: specifically, the tooth space at the point of maximum radial runout on one external gear is engaged with the tooth space at the point of minimum radial runout on the other gear. To prevent errors introduced during reassembly from remaining unresolved, a mark is made at the mating points of the two gears during disassembly, ensuring that the original precision can be restored during reassembly. Removing Axially Positioned Parts
1.5.1 The Significance of Equipment Management Strengthening equipment management and ensuring proper maintenance will keep machinery consistently in excellent condition, thereby extending its lifespan. This not only plays a critical role in boosting production volume and variety, enhancing labor productivity, reducing consumption, lowering costs, and safeguarding worker safety—but also significantly contributes to upgrading the company’s overall production technology, accelerating industrial growth, and protecting productive capacity. Equipment management is an extremely important task—only by effectively managing equipment can organizations achieve optimal economic results with minimal human, financial, and material resources. This, in turn, allows for the full realization of equipment potential, enabling businesses to better meet production goals. Especially in modern manufacturing, prioritizing sound equipment management is a fundamental principle that must be followed. Equipment maintenance management is an important component of enterprise management. Its primary tasks include: maximizing Effectively collecting and utilizing equipment information resources allows for the strategic management of manpower, materials, funds, equipment, and technology within the maintenance system, ensuring that maintenance operations achieve optimal quality and maximum efficiency. The key components of maintenance management include maintenance information management, maintenance planning, maintenance technology, process and quality control, spare parts management, and maintenance economic management. In modern enterprises, management is inseparable from technology, while the effective application of engineering technologies relies on sound management practices. Equipment engineering technicians, who are well-versed in equipment maintenance management principles and methods, should seamlessly integrate technical expertise with managerial skills. To this end, this section will outline the key aspects, methodologies, and practical applications of equipment maintenance management. 1.5.2 Information Management for Equipment Maintenance In corporate equipment maintenance activities, it is often necessary to make various technical and economic decisions, and the basis for these decisions is information. Breath. Without a systematic and reliable information system, effective management becomes difficult to implement. Therefore, the task of equipment maintenance information management is to establish a comprehensive information system that collects, stores, and organizes all types of equipment-related data, while also enabling data processing, output, and feedback—ultimately supporting informed economic and technical decision-making for equipment management. 1. Classification of Equipment Maintenance Information Equipment maintenance information can be complex, but it can generally be categorized using the following methods. 1) Categorized by equipment in the early versus later stages This classification method divides equipment information into two major systems—early-stage and later-stage—and further breaks them down into numerous subsystems. Within these subsystems, various types of equipment are grouped, ultimately leading to a detailed breakdown for each individual device. The approach is straightforward and clear, making it easy to process, organize, and access the information. 2) Categorized by equipment management objectives and performance indicators
Enterprise authorities, investors, and business operators all need to understand and monitor key indicators, such as output value per ten thousand yuan. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance 45 Repair costs, equipment integrity rate, maintenance expenses per 10,000 yuan of equipment value, and more. To facilitate statistical analysis, equipment information can be categorized into five main types: investment planning data, asset and spare parts information, technical condition data, maintenance schedule details, and personnel information. Each category can further be broken down into numerous sub-items and specific evaluation metrics, making it easier to conduct comprehensive classification-based analysis. 3) Categorized from a maintenance perspective Equipment information can be categorized into equipment status information, equipment maintenance information, equipment failure or accident information, repair work information, repair material information, repair personnel information, repair cost information, and related information, among others. 2. Functions of the Computer Repair Information System In modern enterprises, a computer maintenance information system can either serve as a subsystem within the company's management system or operate as an independent system altogether. The functionality of a computer maintenance information system is closely tied to the configuration of both the hardware and software components of computers. Currently, several versatile equipment management software solutions have already been integrated into the system software. The computer maintenance information system offers the following key functions in equipment repair and management: 1) Process Control Function The process control function can be used to monitor equipment operating conditions and detect key performance parameters such as vibration, noise, ultrasound, temperature rise, cooling status, lubrication condition, and environmental factors, providing critical information to guide maintenance activities. 2) Engineering Design and Calculation Functionality The engineering design and calculation function enables mechanical analysis and computations for various equipment and maintenance tooling, as well as supports computer-aided design and drafting, along with diverse optimization processes. 3) Information Processing Function The information processing function handles various types of data in maintenance management, covering the following 5 aspects: (1) Equipment Ledger Management. Store the original data and documentation for all company equipment in a computer system, allowing you to generate workshop equipment ledgers and equipment lists by model—in various formats—as needed. (2) Equipment classification, sorting, querying, and retrieval. Categorize and sort equipment supply information available in the market, storing it in the system to provide insights when companies update or add new equipment. (3) Equipment Maintenance Planning Management. When determining equipment maintenance plans, you can refer to equipment records, maintenance information, and diagnostic data stored in the computer system, and, based on actual conditions, use the computer to develop annual, quarterly, and monthly equipment maintenance schedules. (4) Maintenance Spare Parts Management. By entering the enterprise equipment maintenance spare parts’ demand information, inventory details, and inbound/outbound records into the computer system, users can instantly access real-time inventory status and generate statistical reports. Additionally, an alert notification can be automatically triggered when the current stock level drops below the predefined warning threshold. (5) Other functions. The computer system can also provide service functionalities to the maintenance system, including personnel management, financial management, and technical and process management. 1.5.3 Equipment Maintenance Plan Management The enterprise's equipment management department conducts planned, appropriately scaled maintenance on its equipment. When carrying out specific maintenance tasks, it’s also essential to organize resources effectively to ensure the progress, quality, and efficiency of the repairs. This planning and organizational process is known as Maintenance Planning Management. It comprises two key components: first, a macro-level maintenance plan (including annual, quarterly, and monthly schedules); and second, a detailed tutorial on micro-level mechanical and electrical system fault diagnosis and repair cases. 46 The work plan refers to a specific operational process, such as a major overhaul schedule for a machine, and is characterized by its closer relationship to process technology. Standard Workload for Equipment Maintenance The equipment maintenance work quotas serve as the basis for developing equipment maintenance plans and organizing repair operations. Accurately establishing these maintenance quotas enhances the scientific rigor and predictive capability of maintenance planning, facilitates thorough preparation before repairs begin, and ensures that maintenance activities are conducted in a more cost-effective and rational manner. Before drafting mechanical and electrical equipment maintenance plans, it is essential to first define various maintenance quotas. The main equipment maintenance quotas include: equipment maintenance complexity factor, maintenance labor-hour quota, maintenance downtime quota, maintenance cycle and interval period, and maintenance cost quota. 1) Equipment Maintenance Complexity Factor The equipment maintenance complexity factor, also known as the maintenance complexity unit or simply the maintenance unit, is a hypothetical measure used to assess the intricacy of equipment repair tasks, determine the associated workload, and establish standard benchmarks for various metrics. This assumed unit represents the maintenance effort required for a specific type of machinery, with its value determined by factors such as the equipment's structural design, dimensions, size, and precision levels. In general, the more complex the equipment's structure, the larger its physical dimensions, and the higher the machining accuracy demanded, the greater its maintenance complexity factor will be. For instance, in metal-cutting machine tools, the C620 lathe—typically featuring a maximum workpiece diameter of 400 mm and a maximum workpiece length of 1,000 mm—is often used as the benchmark machine. Its maintenance complexity factor is standardized at 10. As for electrical equipment, the focus shifts to… A protected cage-type synchronous motor with a rated power of 0.6 kW is standard equipment, and its maintenance complexity factor is specified as 1. For other machinery and equipment, the maintenance complexity factor can be determined by comparing their structure, size, precision, and other characteristics to those of the standard unit. Once a labor quota for one maintenance unit (represented by ""R"") has been established, the maintenance workload for any other type of machine can be calculated based on this unit. Additionally, maintenance downtime quotas and cost estimates can also be derived using the maintenance unit as a benchmark. The enterprise's supervisory authority has determined the maintenance complexity factors for various types of equipment and machine tools (establishing separate complexity factors for mechanical and electrical systems), and formulated these into company standards for use during equipment maintenance activities."

Industries and enterprises may also develop their own specialized quality standards for major equipment repairs based on these relevant general technical guidelines. A Practical Guide to Fault Diagnosis and Repair Cases in Mechatronic Systems 30
2) Key Points for Process Specification Work (1) Disassembly process. When repairing mechanical equipment, the first step is to partially disassemble and take it apart. However, each time a machine is disassembled, its performance and precision inevitably suffer some degree of damage. Improper disassembly of precision equipment can even lead to complete报废 of the device. Therefore, it is crucial to approach this process with utmost care and expertise. Key and precision equipment should have dismantling process specifications developed. The general principles and precautions for disassembly will be introduced in Chapter 2 and can serve as a reference when developing the disassembly process. Additionally, please keep the following points in mind. ① Safety comes first during disassembly. Before starting, ensure the power supply is disconnected, remove any hazardous materials—such as toxic or flammable substances—from both inside and outside the machinery and equipment, set up reliable supports, and select appropriate lifting equipment and tools. ② Disassembly for service and maintenance. Do not disassemble components that are unnecessary or prohibited. For parts with tight fits, establish a proper disassembly method and use appropriate tools to avoid damaging critical surfaces. ③ Disassembly serves assembly. When the machine structure is complex and the drawing documentation is incomplete, disassemble while simultaneously documenting details and sketching preliminary diagrams, ultimately compiling a complete assembly drawing. (2) Parts cleaning process. The cleaning process should include details such as the cleaning method, cleaning procedure, type or formulation of the cleaning agent, cleaning parameters, cleaning quality, and important precautions during cleaning. (3) Repair Processes for Typical Components. In equipment maintenance, certain critical parts—such as machine beds, housings, worktables, and large rotating components—often require restoration. To ensure effective repairs and enhance overall efficiency, it’s essential to select the appropriate repair solution and develop a detailed maintenance process procedure. These procedures are typically documented in the form of process cards, which provide more specifics than standard manufacturing process cards yet remain simpler than operation-specific cards. A typical maintenance process card usually includes the following information: ① Part name, drawing number, material and properties, part defect indication diagram, and explanations regarding the defects.
Management of Maintenance Technical Documentation Equipment maintenance technical documentation primarily comes from the technical materials provided as part of the equipment purchase; materials acquired during use from equipment manufacturers, relevant organizations, scientific bookstores, and more; as well as documents designed, surveyed, and compiled in-house. Management is as described below. (1) Specification standards, including relevant international standards, national standards, departmentally issued standards, as well as applicable laws and regulations. (2) Drawing materials, including instruction manuals for mechanical power equipment within the company, partial equipment manufacturing drawings, maintenance and assembly diagrams, spare parts catalogues, and related technical documentation. (3) Layout Diagram of Power Station Equipment and Power Pipeline Network Diagram. (4) Process documentation, including maintenance procedures, parts repair processes, critical component manufacturing techniques, and drawings for specialized tools and fixtures, etc. (5) Maintenance Quality Standards and Equipment Testing Procedures. (6) General technical files, including equipment manuals, research reports, experimental data, calculation notes, cost analyses, claim reports, standard technical materials, patent documents, and relevant literature, among others. (7) Samples and books, including domestic and international samples, books, periodicals, electronic publications, CDs, floppy disks, photographs, and slides, among others. 2) Management Program Maintenance technical documentation is primarily intended for use within the equipment management system and should generally be managed centrally in a dedicated documentation room. The management process should encompass the entire lifecycle of the materials—covering collection, organization, evaluation, classification, numbering, reproduction (such as drafting), storage, retrieval, and distribution. Effective management of technical documentation requires prioritization: key equipment manuals, along with relevant assembly drawings, electrical schematics, and other critical documents, should be clearly marked for enhanced oversight. Importantly, these priority documents are typically not available for external loan. To facilitate compilation and retrieval, it is necessary to establish a coded indexing system for the data and implement computer-based management. The equipment maintenance manual serves as a comprehensive collection of specialized technical documentation for equipment repair, providing maintenance personnel with essential resources for troubleshooting, diagnosing faults, developing repair strategies, and even manufacturing spare parts when needed. The equipment maintenance manuals are compiled separately for each equipment model, and the manuals should include the following content. (1) Features and Feature Diagrams. The features and feature diagrams include an outline diagram, lifting diagram, installation foundation drawing, and Chapter 1—Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance. 51
② Repair procedures and work steps, including operational guidelines for each step and the corresponding technical requirements to be achieved. A Tutorial on Diagnostics and Maintenance Cases for Mechatronic Systems 52 ③ Process specification requirements during the repair process. ④ Equipment, fixtures, tools, measuring instruments, and other materials used during the repair process, as well as the inspection procedures following the repair. Detailed and standardized repair processes and adjustment methods should also be established for the maintenance of critical, precision components, ensuring the quality of repairs. (4) Repair and Assembly Processes. The main contents of the repair and assembly process specifications include preparation for repair and assembly, the sequence for assembling components during repair and overall assembly, repair and assembly methods, analysis of repair dimension chains, adjustment and compensation techniques for ensuring repair assembly accuracy, as well as inspection methods. Additionally, the procedures cover inspection and test runs after repair and assembly. (5) Employ advanced maintenance techniques. In equipment repair, actively learn cutting-edge maintenance processes and technologies from both domestic and international sources. Based on the actual conditions of your enterprise, adopt relatively mature new processes and materials to gradually replace outdated techniques. Develop systems and measures for learning, researching, testing, and implementing advanced maintenance technologies, continuously enhancing the company's equipment repair expertise and process capabilities. 3. Quality Management of Equipment Maintenance To ensure the quality of equipment maintenance, quality management should be implemented for equipment repairs. 1) The content of equipment maintenance and quality management (1) Establish quality standards for equipment maintenance. (2) Develop equipment maintenance procedures. (3) Inspection and evaluation of equipment maintenance quality. (4) Strengthen quality management during the maintenance process. Establish quality control points for critical procedures and encourage participation in grassroots quality management team activities, ensuring thorough implementation of the maintenance process plan. (5) Conduct post-repair customer service and quality feedback activities. (6) Strengthen technical training efforts to enhance both technical and managerial skills. 2) Inspection of Equipment Repair Quality Enterprises should establish organizations and assign personnel responsible for inspecting and evaluating the quality of equipment maintenance. The main aspects of equipment maintenance quality inspection include: ① incoming inspection of purchased spare parts and materials; ② process quality control and final inspection of self-made spare parts and repaired components; ③ quality checks on components and assemblies during the equipment repair process; ④ visual inspection, trial runs, accuracy assessments, and performance tests conducted after repairs are completed. 3) Quality Assurance System for Equipment Maintenance The planning, management, spare parts handling, production oversight, technical administration, financial control, and supply of maintenance materials for equipment repair form an integrated whole. By effectively organizing and coordinating these various aspects of management, we can establish robust systems—complete with management regulations, operational standards, workflow processes, and performance evaluation methods—ultimately creating a comprehensive quality assurance system for equipment maintenance. This ensures high-quality repairs while continuously enhancing our overall maintenance expertise. 1.5.5 Spare Parts Management The process by which enterprises, based on economic and practical principles, determine standard limits for spare parts inventory—such as the quantity of spares to keep in stock, the amount of capital allocated to inventory, and the optimal reserve duration—after gathering relevant data and conducting both calculations and real-world statistical analysis, is known as ""reserve quotas. "" Effective spare parts inventory control requires establishing these precise reserve quotas. There is a wide variety of maintenance spare parts, and the prices, demand, inventory levels, and stockholding durations of these parts vary significantly. Different inventory control methods should be applied to spare parts of varying types and characteristics, as inventory management must also focus on key priorities. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance 53 The ABC analysis categorizes inventory spare parts into 3 classes. (1) Class A Spare Parts. Class A spare parts are a small but critical subset of components, characterized by their high importance, challenging procurement and manufacturing processes, elevated costs, and extended lead times for stockpiling. Although these parts account for approximately 10% of all spare part types, they consume around 80% of the total budget allocated to spare parts. Therefore, Class A items require stringent control measures. Employing inventory theory, carefully determine optimal stock levels and ordering schedules, while maintaining minimal safety stock levels. Additionally, strive to reduce order cycles by increasing the frequency of purchases, thereby accelerating the turnover of spare parts inventory funds. In warehouse management, ensure meticulous recording of all incoming and outgoing spare parts, conduct thorough statistical analysis and calculations of inventory levels, and rigorously implement preventive measures to protect components against corrosion and rust. (2) Category B spare parts. These have a wider variety than Category A spare parts, accounting for about 25% of the total product range, but they require less capital investment—typically around 15% of the total funds allocated to spare parts. Category B spare parts usually maintain a higher safety stock level, though their reserves can be managed more flexibly. Additionally, based on maintenance needs, the ordering cycle can be appropriately extended to reduce the frequency of purchases. (3) Category C spare parts. These account for approximately 65% of all part varieties but represent only about 5% of the total funds allocated to spare parts. For Category C items, inventory levels can be maintained at a slightly higher level based on maintenance needs, and order lead times can be extended accordingly. The focus of spare parts management should be placed on managing Class A and Class B spare parts.

(1) First, disconnect the machine tool's power supply and remove the electrical components (terminals) from the solenoid directional control valve. (2) Use a Phillips screwdriver to remove the solenoid directional control valve, and then detach the side baffles. (3) After removing the springs from both ends, take out the spool of the solenoid directional control valve. 2) Electro-hydraulic directional control valve The structure and appearance of the electro-hydraulic directional control valve are shown in Figure 3.12. 1. 7—Check valve; 2. 6—Throttle valve; 3. 5—Solenoid; 4—Pilot valve spool; 8—Main valve spool Figure 3.12: Structure and Appearance of the Electro-Hydraulic Directional Control Valve The electro-hydraulic directional control valve is composed of a solenoid-operated directional valve and a hydraulically actuated directional valve combined together. The solenoid valve is responsible for switching the flow direction in the control oil circuits connected to both ends of the hydraulically actuated valve, thereby changing the working position of the valve spool—this component is referred to as the pilot valve. Meanwhile, the hydraulically actuated directional valve controls the reversing of the actuator elements within the system and is thus called the main valve. This operating mechanism allows a small electromagnetic force to manage the high-flow switching of the main oil circuit, making it ideal for hydraulic systems requiring large flow rates. As shown in Figure 3.12(a), the structure of the electro-hydraulic directional valve features a three-position, four-way Y-type solenoid valve at the top as the pilot valve, while the main valve below is a three-position, four-way O-type hydraulically actuated directional valve. The centering method for the spool of the three-position, four-way electro-hydraulic directional valve can be either spring-centered or hydraulically centered. When using spring-centering, the pilot valve should be a Y-type, three-position, four-way solenoid directional valve to ensure that, when the main spool is in the neutral position, the control oil chambers on both sides remain continuously connected to the reservoir, maintaining zero pressure. This setup allows the main spool to stay perfectly centered solely under the influence of the spring force. On the other hand, if hydraulic centering is employed, the pilot valve must be a P-type, three-position, four-way solenoid directional valve to guarantee that, in the neutral position, both control oil chambers of the main spool are always pressurized. Additionally, the electro-hydraulic directional valve offers two options for controlling the oil supply to its control circuit: internal oil supply and external oil supply. In the case of internal oil supply, the control circuit draws pressure oil directly from the main oil line via port P—this is known as internal control. For external oil supply, an independent oil source is typically required, which is referred to as external control. Similarly, the return path for the control circuit can also follow either an internal return (internal leakage) or an external return (external leakage), as illustrated in Figure 3.12(b)."

1.4.3 General Principles and Requirements for Mechanical Equipment Disassembly Any piece of machine ry is assembled from numerous components. When machinery requires maintenance, it must first be disassembled so that faulty parts can be repaired or replaced. The primary purpose o f dismantling machinery is to facilitate the inspection and repair of its components; in fact, the disassembly process typically accounts for about 20% of the total maintenance wor kload. Therefore, to ensure high-quality repairs, it’s essential to carefully plan ahead and anticipate potential challenges before starting to take apart the equipment. This way,  the dismantling can proceed methodically—following a structured approach that adheres to the following rules and guidelines. Preparations Before Disassembly (1) Selection and Cleanup of the Disassembly Site. Before disassembly, choose an appropriate work area—avoid locations prone to windblown sand or dust. The workspace should be kept free from frequent unauthorized access by unrelated personnel to prevent unnecessary disruptions or accidents. Additionally, ensure that the ground in the work area remains clean, free from dirt, oil, or other contaminants. Prior to entering the disassembly site, all machinery must undergo an external cleaning process to guarantee that the disassembly procedure does not compromise the equipment’s precision. (2) Protective Measures: Before cleaning the exterior of mechanical equipment, electrical devices should be either removed or properly protected to prevent moisture damage. Additionally, parts prone to oxidation and rust should promptly undergo appropriate protective and maintenance measures. (3) Draining the oil before disassembly. Whenever possible, drain the lubricating oil from the machinery while it’s still hot prior to disassembly, ensuring smoother and more efficient removal work. (4) Understand the structure, performance, and operating principles of mechanical equipment. To avoid unnecessary disassembly and ensure the smooth progress of maintenance work, thoroughly assess all aspects of the machinery before dismantling. Familiarize yourself with the structural features of each component, the transmission system, as well as the specific design characteristics and interrelationships of individual parts. Clearly identify their intended functions and how they interact with one another, enabling you to plan the disassembly process logically and select the appropriate tools or equipment for the job. Mechatronics System Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance Case Study Tutorial
General Principles for Disassembly (1) Based on the structural characteristics of the mechanical equipment, select a logical disassembly sequence. Typically, the process involves dismantling from the overall unit into subassemblies, then breaking down subassemblies into individual components, and finally separating components into their constituent parts—or alternatively, proceeding from accessories to the main unit and from external elements inward. When disassembling particularly complex components, it’s essential to thoroughly study the assembly drawings and carefully analyze the component’s structure as well as the specific roles its parts play within the assembly. Pay special attention to components that require high precision during assembly. This approach helps prevent confusion, ensures an orderly disassembly process, and ultimately facilitates cleaning, inspection, and identification—laying a solid foundation for effective maintenance work. (2) Rational disassembly. During the maintenance and disassembly of mechanical equipment, adhere to the principle of avoiding unnecessary disassembly while ensuring that components requiring removal are indeed taken apart. (3) Use disassembly tools and equipment correctly. After understanding the steps involved in removing mechanical components, it’s crucial to select and properly apply the appropriate disassembly tools. When dismantling, always opt for specialized or suitably matched tools and equipment whenever possible, avoiding random hammering or forceful techniques to prevent damage or deformation of the parts. For instance, when removing shaft sleeves, rolling bearings, gears, pulleys, and similar components, use pullers or hydraulic presses; and for unscrewing studs or nuts, always prefer wrenches that match their dimensions precisely. Precautions During Disassembly: When performing mechanical equipment maintenance, disassembly should also take into account the subsequent assembly tasks. To ensure a smooth process, keep the following points in mind. (1) Ensure thorough verification or marking of disassembled parts. Mechanical equipment often contains numerous precisely matched components and parts, many of which have been specifically selected or balanced for weight—meaning their assembly positions and orientations must not be altered under any circumstances. Therefore, when dismantling, carefully check parts that already bear original markings. If these markings are unclear, misaligned, or missing altogether, re-mark them exactly as they were originally to ensure proper alignment during reassembly, preventing any confusion or errors. (2) Store parts by category. When storing disassembled parts, follow these principles: Parts belonging to the same type or component should be kept together whenever possible; store items according to their size and precision level; non-interchangeable parts must be stored separately in groups; delicate components that are sensitive to dirt or damage should be removed and stored individually; rubber parts should never be stored alongside oil-bearing components; and ensure that easily lost items are carefully accounted for. Parts such as washers and nuts should be strung together with wire or stored in dedicated containers; all types of studs must be fitted with nuts before being placed in storage. Additionally, parts like steel components, aluminum items, rubber pieces, and leather goods should be stored separately in different containers, categorized by their respective material types. (3) Protect the machined surfaces of removed parts. During disassembly, never damage the machined surfaces of the components being taken apart—doing so could complicate repair work and lead to issues such as air, oil, or water leaks, ultimately resulting in reduced performance of the mechanical equipment. 1.4.4 Disassembly Methods for Commonly Used Components The disassembly of commonly used components should follow general disassembly principles, while also considering their specific characteristics and employing appropriate methods tailored to each component in order to achieve the intended purpose. 1. Disassembly of the Spindle Assembly To prevent reduced assembly accuracy due to improper disassembly, mark the relative positions of bearings, washers, tool housings, and spindles around the circumference during removal. After disassembling, group each bearing along with its corresponding inner and outer washers separately and store them in distinct locations—do not mix them up. Ensure that the workbench and surrounding area at the disassembly site remain clean, and immediately place all removed parts into oil to prevent rusting. When reassembling, be sure to reinstall them according to their original marked orientations. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment
Phenomenon After dismantling and cleaning the equipment components, it is impossible to restore them to their original mating precision. Cause Analysis The disassembly and cleaning work did not meet the required standards; additionally, the removed parts were poorly stored, resulting in moisture damage or physical injury—and in some cases, individual parts were even lost and replaced with substitutes. Hazardousness Hazardousness refers to the decline in mechanical equipment performance, potentially leading to complete failure and rendering the equipment unusable. Prevention and Control Measures
Removal Method (1) Striking and Disengaging. Striking involves using the force of a hammer to create relative movement between mating parts, allowing them to separate and achieve disassembly. This is a straightforward method suitable for simpler structures or when dealing with robust, non-critical components. When striking, proceed with caution—improper technique could easily damage the parts. Common tools used for this method include steel hammers, copper hammers, wooden mallets, punches, as well as copper, aluminum, and wooden shims. When removing rolling bearings by striking, always tap symmetrically from both sides; never concentrate the blows on just one side, as this could lead to cracking of the bearing raceway. (2) Press and pull disassembly. Press and pull methods are superior to impact disassembly because they apply force more evenly, allowing precise control over both the magnitude and direction of the force. As a result, these techniques reduce the risk of part misalignment or damage. This method is particularly suitable for dismantling larger components or parts with significant interference fits. Commonly used tools for this process include press benches and pull molds. (3) Hot disassembly. Hot disassembly leverages the thermal expansion properties of metals to separate parts, preventing issues like parts getting stuck or damaged—something that can occur with methods like impact or press disassembly. This technique is commonly used when the interference fit is significant (exceeding 0.1 mm), the components are large in size, or traditional disassembly methods prove impractical. In summary, choose the appropriate removal method based on how the parts fit together. If it’s a transition fit, you can use a tapping method. Remove the part; if it’s a press-fit assembly, you can use either press-off or heat-based disassembly methods. After removal, place the parts on a wooden board or a low surface.

Long, slender components like spindles and lead screws can be hung vertically to prevent bending or deformation. Disassembly of spindle components: The relative positions of parts such as the housing and spindle are ensured using an error-compensation method. To prevent improper disassembly that could compromise assembly accuracy, make sure to mark the circumferential positions of bearings, washers, tool housings, and the spindle itself during disassembly. After removal, arrange the bearings and inner/outer washers separately into their respective groups—never mix them up. Additionally, keep the workbench and surrounding area thoroughly clean during disassembly, and immediately immerse removed parts in oil to prevent rusting. When reassembling, be sure to reinstall them precisely according to the original markings. 2.1.3 Cleaning, Inspection, and Repair After Shaft Removal

1.2.4 Use of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment During operation, equipment's technical condition changes—and its performance gradually declines—due to various forces acting upon it, as well as factors such as environmental conditions, usage methods, operational guidelines, and the duration of use. To effectively manage these changes in technical condition and slow down the decline in equipment performance, the most critical measure is to ensure the equipment is used properly and correctly. Maintenance of mechanical and electrical equipment is a crucial method for improving utilization and ensuring its functionality—it consists of two forms: daily maintenance and periodic maintenance. Daily maintenance is primarily carried out by operators of mechanical and electrical equipment—conducting pre-shift inspections and post-shift cleaning to ensure that the equipment remains in optimal technical condition. Regular maintenance, also known as Level 1 care, is carried out by operators with assistance from maintenance personnel. It’s similar to minor repairs and is covered in Chapter 1 of the ""Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance. "" 13
Cultivate a culture and habit of consciously caring for equipment, ensuring it remains regularly clean, safe, and in optimal technical condition. 1.2.5 Maintenance and保养 of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment 1) Principles of Operation and Maintenance Procedures Mechanical and electrical equipment maintenance refers to the tasks performed to eliminate inevitable abnormal technical conditions that arise during operation (such as loose parts, dry friction, or unusual noises). Overall, maintaining mechanical and electrical equipment requires meeting four fundamental criteria: neatness, cleanliness, lubrication, and safety. Developing clear equipment operation and maintenance procedures is a crucial step in ensuring that all subsequent operations are carried out systematically and efficiently. The principles for creating these operational and maintenance guidelines are outlined below. (1) General guidelines should list precautions according to the equipment operation sequence, as well as before, during, and after shifts—aiming for concise, clear, and practical content. (2) List the structural features, processing range, operational precautions, maintenance requirements, and more separately by equipment category, making it easier for operators to grasp the key points and ensure proper implementation. (3) Common elements across various types of mechanical and electrical equipment can be used to develop a unified, standard general procedure. (4) Key equipment, high-precision, large and medium-sized, as well as rare and critical electromechanical devices, must have operation and maintenance procedures prepared separately. Also, post prominent signage near the machine tool, clearly indicating that operators should pay special attention and strictly adhere to the guidelines. 2) Basic Content of Operation and Maintenance Procedures

2) Key Points for Process Specification Work (1) Disassembly process. When repairing mechanical equipment, the first step is to partially disassemble and take it apart. However, each time a machine is disassembled, its performance and precision inevitably suffer some degree of damage. Improper disassembly of precision equipment can even lead to complete报废 of the device. Therefore, it is crucial to approach this process with utmost care and expertise. Key and precision equipment should have dismantling process specifications developed. The general principles and precautions for disassembly will be introduced in Chapter 2 and can serve as a reference when developing the disassembly process. Additionally, please keep the following points in mind. ① Safety comes first during disassembly. Before starting, ensure the power supply is disconnected, remove any hazardous materials—such as toxic or flammable substances—from both inside and outside the machinery and equipment, set up reliable supports, and select appropriate lifting equipment and tools. ② Disassembly for service and maintenance. Do not disassemble components that are unnecessary or prohibited. For parts with tight fits, establish a proper disassembly method and use appropriate tools to avoid damaging critical surfaces. ③ Disassembly serves assembly. When the machine structure is complex and the drawing documentation is incomplete, disassemble while simultaneously documenting details and sketching preliminary diagrams, ultimately compiling a complete assembly drawing. (2) Parts cleaning process. The cleaning process should include details such as the cleaning method, cleaning procedure, type or formulation of the cleaning agent, cleaning parameters, cleaning quality, and important precautions during cleaning. (3) Repair Processes for Typical Components. In equipment maintenance, certain critical parts—such as machine beds, housings, worktables, and large rotating components—often require restoration. To ensure effective repairs and enhance overall efficiency, it’s essential to select the appropriate repair solution and develop a detailed maintenance process procedure. These procedures are typically documented in the form of process cards, which provide more specifics than standard manufacturing process cards yet remain simpler than operation-specific cards. A typical maintenance process card usually includes the following information: ① Part name, drawing number, material and properties, part defect indication diagram, and explanations regarding the defects.
2. Manufacturing Cause Equipment manufacturing and component production often proceed smoothly with no issues in the overall design—but unexpected failures still tend to arise during installation and commissioning. For instance, at one company, the valve test bench of a multifunctional hydraulic component testing station failed to perform pressure tests during debugging. Upon inspection, it was discovered that the oil passages connecting the integrated block had been improperly machined, causing the pressure and return lines to inadvertently merge. As a result, sufficient pressure couldn’t be built up. After reworking the affected areas, the issue was resolved, allowing the commissioning process to proceed smoothly and successfully complete. For instance, improper clearance between the valve body and spool of a slide valve can lead to leakage or seizing. Additionally, if the mating surfaces between the valve body and the machine housing fail to meet manufacturing tolerances for flatness, deformation may occur under tightening pressure after assembly, causing the spool to become stuck inside the valve body—resulting in restricted or complete blockage of movement. Furthermore, during manufacturing, some valve bodies may not undergo reliable stress-relief treatments. As a result, residual stresses redistribute over time during operation, leading to deformation of the valve body. This not only compromises the original fit and function but also causes the slide valve to move sluggishly or even jam completely within the valve body. Some manufacturers fail to flush the hydraulic system during final assembly, opting instead to rely on cleaning components individually as they are assembled—thus skipping the critical step of flushing the system itself. This practice often leaves behind contaminants introduced during the assembly process, which can become a significant and frequently overlooked cause of system failures. Hydraulic system flushing involves using fluid flow at specific pressure and velocity levels to thoroughly clean and rinse every circuit within the entire system. However, cleaning components before assembly cannot replace the essential step of flushing the system after it has been fully assembled. During assembly, there’s always a risk of damaging seals or scratching/abrasively affecting metal parts. Additionally, adhesives, liquid sealants, or PTFE tape used when connecting pipes and components may inadvertently get pushed into the system, introducing contaminants that compromise its performance even after assembly is complete. 3. Reason for Use
(2) Fault Diagnosis and Repair. ① Improper assembly. Without applying load to the hydraulic cylinder, measure its minimum operating resistance. If the resistance is excessively high, it indicates the presence of binding. Such binding typically arises from incorrect hydraulic cylinder assembly practices. Therefore, during the assembly process, strictly follow the specified assembly procedures to ensure that the piston and piston rod move freely without being subjected to lateral forces or torsional stresses. Additionally, verify that the sealing elements maintain appropriate resistance levels and are in optimal condition. ② The reaction force from the load causes the hydraulic cylinder to become skewed. This binding phenomenon in the hydraulic cylinder, resulting from the applied load force, typically becomes noticeable only when the cylinder is pushing the load into motion. For instance, a hydraulic cylinder equipped with base mounts may experience insufficient rigidity in its feet; as a result, when the cylinder moves the load, the reaction force from the load induces flexible deformation in the foot mounts, leading to skewing of the cylinder and the onset of binding. Therefore, during installation, hydraulic cylinders must not only maintain adequate positional accuracy but also ensure sufficient structural rigidity. 2) Causes of Creep Failure Due to Seals and Maintenance Measures Hydraulic cylinders are significantly affected by seal rings when it comes to the phenomenon of creep. In most cases, the first step should be to check whether the piston rod support seals and piston seals are tightened too much. If creep occurs when the hydraulic cylinder's movement speed drops below 5 mm/s, no other solutions will work effectively. When selecting seals, care should be taken to ensure proper performance. To eliminate creeping, the seal material must have a minimal difference between its dynamic and static friction coefficients. Additionally, the sealing design itself should minimize resistance while maximizing rigidity; after being subjected to tensile forces, it should exhibit low elongation. Ideally, the sealing material would possess negative friction characteristics—meaning that as sliding speed increases, so does the resistance. For instance, seals made from leather or polytetrafluoroethylene are well-suited for low-speed applications in hydraulic cylinders. However, V-shaped seals containing only nitrile rubber are not recommended for use in low-speed scenarios. 3) Causes and Maintenance of Crawling Faults Caused by Hydraulic Component Wear"

Context:  
General Principles for Disassembly (1) Based on the structural characteristics of the mechanical equipment, select a logical disassembly sequence. Typically, the process involves dismantling from the overall unit into subassemblies, then breaking down subassemblies into individual components, and finally separating components into their constituent parts—or alternatively, proceeding from accessories to the main unit and from external elements inward. When disassembling particularly complex components, it’s essential to thoroughly study the assembly drawings and carefully analyze the component’s structure as well as the specific roles its parts play within the assembly. Pay special attention to components that require high precision during assembly. This approach helps prevent confusion, ensures an orderly disassembly process, and ultimately facilitates cleaning, inspection, and identification—laying a solid foundation for effective maintenance work. (2) Rational disassembly. During the maintenance and disassembly of mechanical equipment, adhere to the principle of avoiding unnecessary disassembly while ensuring that components requiring removal are indeed taken apart. (3) Use disassembly tools and equipment correctly. After understanding the steps involved in removing mechanical components, it’s crucial to select and properly apply the appropriate disassembly tools. When dismantling, always opt for specialized or suitably matched tools and equipment whenever possible, avoiding random hammering or forceful techniques to prevent damage or deformation of the parts. For instance, when removing shaft sleeves, rolling bearings, gears, pulleys, and similar components, use pullers or hydraulic presses; and for unscrewing studs or nuts, always prefer wrenches that match their dimensions precisely. Precautions During Disassembly: When performing mechanical equipment maintenance, disassembly should also take into account the subsequent assembly tasks. To ensure a smooth process, keep the following points in mind. (1) Ensure thorough verification or marking of disassembled parts. Mechanical equipment often contains numerous precisely matched components and parts, many of which have been specifically selected or balanced for weight—meaning their assembly positions and orientations must not be altered under any circumstances. Therefore, when dismantling, carefully check parts that already bear original markings. If these markings are unclear, misaligned, or missing altogether, re-mark them exactly as they were originally to ensure proper alignment during reassembly, preventing any confusion or errors. (2) Store parts by category. When storing disassembled parts, follow these principles: Parts belonging to the same type or component should be kept together whenever possible; store items according to their size and precision level; non-interchangeable parts must be stored separately in groups; delicate components that are sensitive to dirt or damage should be removed and stored individually; rubber parts should never be stored alongside oil-bearing components; and ensure that easily lost items are carefully accounted for. Parts such as washers and nuts should be strung together with wire or stored in dedicated containers; all types of studs must be fitted with nuts before being placed in storage. Additionally, parts like steel components, aluminum items, rubber pieces, and leather goods should be stored separately in different containers, categorized by their respective material types. (3) Protect the machined surfaces of removed parts. During disassembly, never damage the machined surfaces of the components being taken apart—doing so could complicate repair work and lead to issues such as air, oil, or water leaks, ultimately resulting in reduced performance of the mechanical equipment. 1.4.4 Disassembly Methods for Commonly Used Components The disassembly of commonly used components should follow general disassembly principles, while also considering their specific characteristics and employing appropriate methods tailored to each component in order to achieve the intended purpose. 1. Disassembly of the Spindle Assembly To prevent reduced assembly accuracy due to improper disassembly, mark the relative positions of bearings, washers, tool housings, and spindles around the circumference during removal. After disassembling, group each bearing along with its corresponding inner and outer washers separately and store them in distinct locations—do not mix them up. Ensure that the workbench and surrounding area at the disassembly site remain clean, and immediately place all removed parts into oil to prevent rusting. When reassembling, be sure to reinstall them according to their original marked orientations. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment

(3) Removed parts must be stored properly and protected from moisture, damage, or loss.
Removal Method (1) Striking and Disengaging. Striking involves using the force of a hammer to create relative movement between mating parts, allowing them to separate and achieve disassembly. This is a straightforward method suitable for simpler structures or when dealing with robust, non-critical components. When striking, proceed with caution—improper technique could easily damage the parts. Common tools used for this method include steel hammers, copper hammers, wooden mallets, punches, as well as copper, aluminum, and wooden shims. When removing rolling bearings by striking, always tap symmetrically from both sides; never concentrate the blows on just one side, as this could lead to cracking of the bearing raceway. (2) Press and pull disassembly. Press and pull methods are superior to impact disassembly because they apply force more evenly, allowing precise control over both the magnitude and direction of the force. As a result, these techniques reduce the risk of part misalignment or damage. This method is particularly suitable for dismantling larger components or parts with significant interference fits.

Removal Method (1) Striking and Disengaging. Striking involves using the force of a hammer to create relative movement between mating parts, allowing them to separate and achieve disassembly. This is a straightforward method suitable for simpler structures or when dealing with robust, non-critical components. When striking, proceed with caution—improper technique could easily damage the parts. Common tools used for this method include steel hammers, copper hammers, wooden mallets, punches, as well as copper, aluminum, and wooden shims. When removing rolling bearings by striking, always tap symmetrically from both sides; never concentrate the blows on just one side, as this could lead to cracking of the bearing raceway. (2) Press and pull disassembly. Press and pull methods are superior to impact disassembly because they apply force more evenly, allowing precise control over both the magnitude and direction of the force. As a result, these techniques reduce the risk of part misalignment or damage. This method is particularly suitable for dismantling larger components or parts with significant interference fits. Commonly used tools for this process include press benches and pull molds. (3) Hot disassembly. Hot disassembly leverages the thermal expansion properties of metals to separate parts, preventing issues like parts getting stuck or damaged—something that can occur with methods like impact or press disassembly. This technique is commonly used when the interference fit is significant (exceeding 0.1 mm), the components are large in size, or traditional disassembly methods prove impractical. In summary, choose the appropriate removal method based on how the parts fit together. If it’s a transition fit, you can use a tapping method. Remove the part; if it’s a press-fit assembly, you can use either press-off or heat-based disassembly methods. After removal, place the parts on a wooden board or a low surface. Chapter 2: Troubleshooting and Repair of Commonly Used Components 57 On the platform; smaller parts such as screws, nuts, washers, pins, and others can be placed in dedicated boxes. Long, slender components like spindles and lead screws can be hung vertically to prevent bending or deformation. Disassembly of spindle components: The relative positions of parts such as the housing and spindle are ensured using an error-compensation method. To prevent improper disassembly that could compromise assembly accuracy, make sure to mark the circumferential positions of bearings, washers, tool housings, and the spindle itself during disassembly. After removal, arrange the bearings and inner/outer washers separately into their respective groups—never mix them up. Additionally, keep the workbench and surrounding area thoroughly clean during disassembly, and immediately immerse removed parts in oil to prevent rusting. When reassembling, be sure to reinstall them precisely according to the original markings. 2.1.3 Cleaning, Inspection, and Repair After Shaft Removal
When designing bearing assemblies, consider the ease of installation and removal to prevent damage to the bearing and other components during these processes. Bearing installation: Small bearings can be gently and evenly tapped into place using a copper hammer to fit the retaining rings; larger bearings should be pressed in with a hydraulic press. Bearings that are large in size and tightly fitted can be heated to expand the bore before assembly. Bearing installation and removal: Specialized tools can be used; when designing the structure, ensure ease of bearing installation and removal. 1. Disassembling Rolling Bearings Disassembling rolling bearings is an essential part of mechanical maintenance. Since rolling bearings are tightly fitted to the shaft, significant force is required to remove them. If the disassembly method is improper, not only may the bearing fail to come off, but if the fit is particularly tight—with a large interference—the process could also damage the bearing and its associated components. Here, we introduce several commonly used methods for removing bearings. (1) Heating Disassembly Method. If the bearing is tightly fitted and has a significant interference fit, the bearing must be heated to induce thermal expansion, causing elastic deformation that allows for easy removal. For instance, you can wrap the shaft near the bearing with asbestos cloth and then heat the inner race of the bearing using an acetylene-oxygen flame—this method enables disassembly while heating continues. However, it’s crucial to heat slowly, keeping the temperature around 100°C to prevent damage to the bearing. (2) If the bearing has a loose fit, you can carefully tap the fitting ring of the bearing with a wooden mallet to remove it. When tapping, make sure to work evenly around the circumference—avoid focusing on just one spot repeatedly. In some cases, a steel hammer may also be used, but in this scenario, always place a wooden block between the hammer and the bearing to ensure that the force is distributed evenly across the bearing, preventing damage. (3) Select a metal material to create a sleeve, ensuring the inner diameter of the sleeve is slightly larger than the journal diameter. During removal, support the sleeve with an appropriate object. If the fit is loose, gently tap the shaft end with a hammer to detach the bearing; if the fit is tight, apply force to the shaft end using a press or jack. Alternatively, if using the sleeve proves inconvenient, you can also substitute it with two clamping plates. Chapter 2: Fault Diagnosis and Repair of Commonly Used Components 65 (4) Tensioner Disassembly Method. Use a tensioner to remove the shaft. ""Contraction is a commonly used disassembly method; the tension device consists of a pull hook and..."" Threaded transmission assembly. When disassembling, hang the hook on the inner ring.

This method can be used for disassembly, as shown in Figure 2.8. (5) If the bearing cannot be pulled out using a puller, The ring can simultaneously cool the outer race of the bearing locally using dry ice, yet… Then quickly pull the outer race of the tapered roller bearing out of the gear. 2. Bearing Cleaning (1) Hot Oil Cleaning Method. For bearings hardened by soft dry oil or rust-preventive grease, immerse them in hot motor oil heated to 100–200°C. Use pliers to grip the bearing and gently scrub away any oil contamination with a brush. When heated to 100–200°C, soft dry oil or rust-preventive grease will melt, allowing it to easily flush out of the bearing’s crevices. In some cases, simply shaking the bearing repeatedly in the oil is enough to dislodge the dirt and grime from between the gaps. When cleaning the radial spherical ball bearings of old or imported electric motors, the balls, retainer, and inner ring should be carefully turned horizontally out of the outer ring before being immersed in hot oil. Similarly, when cleaning short cylindrical roller bearings, the rollers, retainer, inner ring, and outer ring must first be separated from one another. When cleaning with hot oil, the oil temperature should not exceed 20°C. If using an open flame for direct heating, be careful to prevent the oil from catching fire. The bearing should be suspended inside the oil pot—immersing it completely at the bottom could cause overheating and reduce its hardness. (2) General Cleaning Method: Place the bearing in kerosene and soak it for 5–10 minutes. While holding the inner ring with one hand, gently rotate the outer ring with the other—this will cause any soft dry grease or rust-preventive paste on the bearing to fall off. Next, transfer the bearing to a container of cleaner kerosene and use a fine, soft-bristled brush to thoroughly clean away oil stains from the raceways and between the rolling elements. Finally, rinse the bearing once more in gasoline before carefully placing it onto a clean piece of paper. When cleaning spherical ball bearings and short cylindrical roller bearings, separate the balls, retainer cage, inner ring, and outer ring for individual cleaning. For bearings already mounted on a shaft, cleaning is typically done by pouring oil directly over them or using an oil gun for targeted spraying. Start with kerosene to remove easily loosened oil deposits, followed by gasoline for tougher residues. If oil stains persist, first apply hot engine oil heated to 100–200°C via pouring or spraying, then finish with gasoline. Always remember not to scrape off hardened oil buildup or rust from the bearing surfaces using sharp tools, as this could damage the smoothness of the rolling elements and raceway grooves. After cleaning, dry the bearing thoroughly with a clean cloth. 3. Inspection of Rolling Bearings For rolling bearings, focus should be placed on inspecting the inner and outer raceways. The entire working surface must be smooth, free from defects such as cracks, micropores, dents, and peeling. Similarly, the surfaces of the rolling elements themselves should be flawless, with no cracks, micropores, or dents. Additionally, the retainer must remain intact, and all rivets should be securely fastened. If clearance is detected between the inner and outer races of the bearing, avoid replacing it immediately—instead, consider adjusting it through preloading to eliminate any increased clearance caused by wear, thereby enhancing its rotational accuracy. 2.4.4 Assembly of Rolling Bearings Rolling bearings consist of an inner ring, outer ring, rolling elements, and a cage—they are the bearing components that enable relative motion between the shaft and the bearing housing through rolling friction. Rolling bearings offer advantages such as low friction coefficients, high efficiency, compact axial dimensions, and ease of assembly and disassembly, making them widely used in various types of machinery and equipment. As standardized components mass-produced by specialized factories, rolling bearings come with predetermined inner diameters, outer diameters, and axial widths at the time of manufacture. Consequently, the inner ring of a rolling bearing serves as the reference hole, while the outer ring acts as the reference shaft.

4. Measures to Reduce Fracture Failure Fracture failure is one of the most dangerous forms of failure, and most metal parts fail due to various factors arising from metallurgy and part manufacturing processes. Because all of them contain cracks of varying sizes and characteristics, ranging from atomic-level dislocations to macroscopic cracks visible to the naked eye. However, a part with cracks doesn’t necessarily fail immediately—there’s typically a period during which these cracks undergo subcritical propagation. Moreover, under certain conditions, cracks may even remain stable without expanding at all. Therefore, by implementing effective measures, it’s possible to ensure that parts containing cracks do not ultimately fracture. Strategies to minimize fracture failures can be considered from the following perspectives. 1) Optimize the shape and structural design of parts, and carefully select appropriate materials for the components. Both geometric discontinuities in part shapes and material imperfections can lead to stress concentration. Geometric discontinuities are commonly referred to as notches, such as fillets at shoulders, grooves, oil holes, keyways, threads, and machining marks. Material-related discontinuities are typically called material defects, including shrinkage porosity, shrinkage cavities, non-metallic inclusions, and welding flaws. These areas prone to stress concentration are particularly susceptible to crack initiation and propagation under cyclic or impact loading, ultimately leading to fracture. Therefore, in part design, it’s crucial to minimize stress-concentration zones while carefully considering the part’s operating environment—such as the presence of corrosive media, temperature variations, and applied loads—and selecting appropriate materials accordingly. This approach helps effectively reduce the risk of fatigue failure. 2) Properly select the part machining method During various machining, welding, and heat treatment processes, residual stresses remain inside components due to factors such as plastic deformation, thermal expansion and contraction, and phase transformations occurring during these operations. Residual stresses are categorized into two types: residual tensile stress and residual compressive stress. While residual tensile stress is detrimental to component performance, residual compressive stress can significantly enhance the fatigue life of the part. Therefore, it is advisable to prioritize processes like carburizing, nitriding, shot peening, and surface rolling—methods known for generating beneficial compressive stresses—in component manufacturing. By inducing compressive stresses on the component’s surface, these techniques help counteract some of the tensile stresses caused by external loads, thereby improving the overall durability and longevity of the part. 3) Installation and Usage Instructions
Take machine tools as an example; the process flow for a major overhaul of metal-cutting machine tools is shown in Figure 1.5.

Cleaning After Shaft Removal Cleaning the disassembled mechanical parts is a crucial step in maintenance work. The cleaning method and the quality of removal directly impact the accuracy of parts inspection. Certainty, the quality of equipment repair, maintenance costs, and service life will all be significantly impacted. Part cleaning involves removing oil stains, scale, carbon deposits, rust layers, and old paint coatings. The tools required for cleaning include wrenches, circlip pliers, cleaning solutions, grease, a hairdryer, cloths, needles, and a container specifically designed for soaking the shaft.

Inspection of the Spindle The main forms of spindle damage include journal wear, surface scratches, and the resulting roundness errors, concentricity errors, and bending deformation. Including cone hole dam age, keyway cracks, and thread failures. Common checks for the coaxiality of each spindle journal are shown in Figure 2.2. 1—Spindle; 2—Plug; 3—Steel ball; 4—Support plate; 5—V-sha ped frame; 6—Inspection flat plate Figure 2.2: Common Methods for Checking the Coaxiality of Each Journal on the Main Shaft The spindle 1 is placed on two V-shaped supports 5 mount ed on the inspection plate 6. The rear end of the spindle is fitted with a plug 2, which features a steel ball 3 positioned at the center hole and resting against the support plate  4. At each journal of the spindle, a dial indicator tip is brought into contact with the journal surface. By rotating the spindle, the difference in movement indicated by the dial  gauge pointer directly reflects the coaxial error. Additionally, the circular runout error at the shoulder end face can also be measured using the dial indicator positioned at the  end face. Generally, coaxial error should be kept within 0.015, and the face runout error should be less than 0.01 mm. As for the spindle taper bore... The radial runout error of  the spindle centerline relative to the bearing journal can be checked by inserting a tapered shank gauge into the properly positioned spindle taper bore. Then, touch the dial indic ator probe to two points on the tapered shank gauge—one near the spindle end and the other 300 mm away—and rotate the spindle while observing the dial indicator readings. The indic ator can be used to measure the radial circular runout of the tapered hole's centerline relative to the spindle bearing journal.

(1) Remove air from the hydraulic oil.
When disassembling shaft components from the gearbox, it is essential to first determine the direction of the shaft's steps, which will dictate the movement direction during removal. Next, remove the shaft caps at both ends, along with any axial positioning parts on the shaft, such as set screws, locknuts, spring washers, and retaining springs. Disassembling Threaded Connections In mechanical equipment, threaded connections are the most widely used method of joining components. They offer advantages such as simple structure, convenient adjustment, and the ability to be repeatedly disassembled and reassembled. While these connections are relatively easy to dismantle, improper handling—such as insufficient attention, incorrect tool selection, or improper dismantling techniques—often leads to damage. Therefore, when removing threaded fasteners, it’s crucial to use the right wrench or screwdriver; always avoid using adjustable wrenches whenever possible. For particularly tough-to-remove threaded joints, first determine the direction of the thread rotation, and never force the connection by twisting randomly or applying excessive leverage with an overly long extension bar. When removing double-ended studs, always use a specialized wrench designed specifically for this purpose. Disassembling Interference-Fit Components When disassembling interference-fit components, select the appropriate removal method, tools, and equipment based on the part's fit dimensions and the size of the interference. Suitable options include pullers, presses, and other specialized tools. Avoid directly striking components with a steel hammer to prevent damage. If no dedicated tools are available, you can use a wooden mallet, copper mallet, or plastic hammer, or alternatively, tap gently using a wooden (or block-shaped) or copper (or block-shaped) rod as a cushion against the steel hammer. Disassembling rolling bearings falls under the category of removing interference-fit components; this process is particularly versatile due to the unique characteristics of these bearings. Therefore, when disassembling, you must not only follow the key points for removing interference-fit components but also take into account their unique characteristics.

3. Spindle Maintenance Under normal circumstances, the primary failure modes of spindles are bending deformation caused by external loads, as well as we ar on the mating surfaces. If a spindle becomes deformed, the repair method should be determined based on the extent of the deformation and the spindle's precision requirements. Fo r ordinary-precision spindles that have undergone bending deformation, straightening is an effective repair technique.

Electroplating Repair Technology Electroplating is a process that uses electrolysis to deposit metal onto the surface of a part, forming a metallic coating. The electroplating repair method not only restores the dimensions of worn parts but also enhances their surface quality—particularly improving wear resistance and corrosion resistance. Electroplating repair technology is a widely used technique for restoring component dimensions under low-temperature conditions. Compared to welding repair methods, it avoids the various issues caused by localized high temperatures, while the bond strength between the electroplated layer and the substrate is nearly equivalent to that achieved with welding repairs. This technique leverages the principle of electrolysis: metal ions from the plating solution are reduced into metallic atoms, which then deposit onto the metal surface, forming a repair layer with strong adhesion and precise thickness control. Common applications include chrome plating, low-temperature iron plating, and brush plating."

What are the common failures of plain bearings? What are the associated hazards, and how can they be prevented? Condition-Based Maintenance System It is based on reliability theory, condition monitoring, and fault diagnosis, determining the timing and scope of maintenance based on actual technical condition assessments of mechanical and electrical equipment. Given that many complex mechanical and electrical systems typically experience only early or occasional failures—without a wear-out phase—regular, scheduled maintenance often proves ineffective against such faults. Moreover, in modern mechanical and electrical systems, only a small number of component failures pose safety risks; thus, maintenance tasks should be tailored specifically to the functional requirements of each part, considering potential functional failures, their root causes, and their consequences. This maintenance approach is characterized by flexible decision-making regarding maintenance cycles, procedures, and scopes—adapting dynamically to the actual conditions of the equipment. It shifts the focus of maintenance activities from routine repairs and upkeep to proactive inspections, underpinned by the implementation of a systematic inspection system. Not only does this inspection process provide critical information for determining optimal maintenance timing and scope, but it also allows certain maintenance tasks to be carried out incrementally and efficiently. By conducting daily, periodic, and precision inspections of mechanical and electrical equipment, combined with thorough analysis of condition-monitoring and fault-diagnosis data, operators can accurately assess the degree of degradation and proactively address issues before they escalate into full-blown failures. This approach ensures that equipment remains reliably operational while maximizing the lifespan of its components—making it far more efficient and cost-effective than traditional planned preventive maintenance strategies. To successfully implement condition-based maintenance, several prerequisites must be met: robust reliability testing data and comprehensive documentation are essential for effectively managing the mechanical and electrical systems. 2.3 Maintenance and Assembly of Sliding Bearings Sliding bearings feature a simple structure, ease of manufacturing, convenient assembly and disassembly, strong load-carrying capacity, as well as excellent shock resistance and vibration-absorbing properties.

1.3.4 Fracture of Mechanical Parts Fracture refers to the phenomenon where a mechanical component develops localized cracks or splits into several parts under the influence of certain factors. It is one of the primary modes of mechanical component failure—once a part fractures, it not only completely loses its functionality but can also lead to significant economic losses and even cause accidents resulting in injuries or fatalities. Particularly as modern manufacturing systems continue to evolve toward higher power levels and faster rotational speeds, the operating conditions for components have changed dramatically, increasing the likelihood of fracture-related failures. As a result, fracture failure has become a hot topic of research today. The fracture surface formed after a part breaks can accurately capture the dynamic evolution of the failure process. By analyzing the fracture surface, it is possible to identify the primary cause of the fracture, providing valuable insights that help refine designs and enable effective repairs. Based on the cause of failure, fractures can be categorized into types such as brittle fracture and fatigue fracture. Brittle Fracture Before fracturing, the component exhibits no noticeable plastic deformation; this type of fracture, which develops extremely rapidly, is known as brittle fracture.  Brittle fracture occurs without any prior warning signs, making it a sudden and highly dangerous form of failure. Metal parts may become brittle—and thus prone to sudden fracture— due to improper manufacturing processes, exposure to corrosive media during use, or adverse environmental conditions. For instance, the penetration of hydrogen or hydrides into met al materials can lead to  ""hydrogen embrittlement, "" while chloride ions infiltrating austenitic stainless steel may cause  ""chloride stress corrosion cracking. "" Similarly, nitrate ions entering carbon steel can trigger  ""nitrate embrittlement, "" and steel in contact with alkaline substances might suffer from  ""alkali embrittlement. "" Additionally, copper components exposed to ammonia can experience  ""ammonia-induced embrittlement. "" Furthermore, at ambient temperatures between 10°C and 15°C, medium- to low-strength carbon steels are particularly susceptible to  ""cold embrittlement "" (often caused by elevated phosphorus content in the steel). Meanwhile, aluminum-containing alloys, if not carefully temperature-controlled during heat treatment, can easily overh eat—even with only a slight deviation from the optimal range—leading to severe embrittlement. The hazards posed by brittle fracture in metals are significant, second only to those  associated with fatigue failure. Fatigue Fracture The fracture phenomenon that occurs in metal parts after being subjected to a certain number of cyclic loads or alternating stresses is known as fatigue failure. In fact, 80% of fractures in mechanical components during use are caused by fatigue. Typically, fatigue failure progresses through three distinct stages: the initiation phase of fatigue cracks; the propagation phase of fatigue cracks; and finally, catastrophic failure—the unstable, rapid growth phase of the fatigue crack. Below, we will analyze the fracture surfaces associated with fatigue failure. A typical fatigue fracture typically exhibits 3 distinct features based on the fracture process. Regions with distinct characteristics: fatigue core zone, fatigue crack propagation Zone and transient zone, as shown in Figure 1.4. Fatigue Core Zone It is the source region of fatigue fracture, visible to the naked eye or under low magnification. A magnifying glass can pinpoint the location of the fatigue core on the fracture surface—it typically does. Appearing in the area with the lowest intensity, highest stress, and closest to the surface Position. But if there are defects inside the material, this fatigue core... It could also occur at the defect site. Scratches left behind during the machining, storage, transportation, and assembly processes are highly likely to become fatigue nuclei, as these marks not only cause stress concentrations but also remain vulnerable to corrosion damage from air and other environmental factors.

1.4.3 General Principles and Requirements for Mechanical Equipment Disassembly Any piece of machine ry is assembled from numerous components. When machinery requires maintenance, it must first be disassembled so that faulty parts can be repaired or replaced. The primary purpose o f dismantling machinery is to facilitate the inspection and repair of its components; in fact, the disassembly process typically accounts for about 20% of the total maintenance wor kload. Therefore, to ensure high-quality repairs, it’s essential to carefully plan ahead and anticipate potential challenges before starting to take apart the equipment. This way,  the dismantling can proceed methodically—following a structured approach that adheres to the following rules and guidelines. Preparations Before Disassembly (1) Selection and Cleanup of the Disassembly Site. Before disassembly, choose an appropriate work area—avoid locations prone to windblown sand or dust. The workspace should be kept free from frequent unauthorized access by unrelated personnel to prevent unnecessary disruptions or accidents. Additionally, ensure that the ground in the work area remains clean, free from dirt, oil, or other contaminants. Prior to entering the disassembly site, all machinery must undergo an external cleaning process to guarantee that the disassembly procedure does not compromise the equipment’s precision. (2) Protective Measures: Before cleaning the exterior of mechanical equipment, electrical devices should be either removed or properly protected to prevent moisture damage. Additionally, parts prone to oxidation and rust should promptly undergo appropriate protective and maintenance measures. (3) Draining the oil before disassembly. Whenever possible, drain the lubricating oil from the machinery while it’s still hot prior to disassembly, ensuring smoother and more efficient removal work. (4) Understand the structure, performance, and operating principles of mechanical equipment. To avoid unnecessary disassembly and ensure the smooth progress of maintenance work, thoroughly assess all aspects of the machinery before dismantling. Familiarize yourself with the structural features of each component, the transmission system, as well as the specific design characteristics and interrelationships of individual parts. Clearly identify their intended functions and how they interact with one another, enabling you to plan the disassembly process logically and select the appropriate tools or equipment for the job. Mechatronics System Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance Case Study Tutorial
During operation,机电设备 inevitably experience gradual wear, deformation, fracture, corrosion, and other forms of failure in their components. As a result, the equipment's precision,  performance, and productivity decline, potentially leading to malfunctions, accidents, or even complete报废 (scrapping). This underscores the critical need for timely maintenance and  repairs. In restorative maintenance, all measures are aimed at restoring the equipment as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. Effectively eliminate failures to enhance the e quipment's overall utilization rate. Additionally, implementing repair techniques to restore failed components can efficiently achieve this goal. When repairing damage or defects i n mechanical parts, several methods and techniques may be available, but determining the best approach depends on considering the following factors. (1) Consider the compatibility  of the selected repair technique with the part material. When choosing a repair method, the first step should be to determine whether the technique is suitable for the material of  the component being repaired. For instance, manual arc welding is ideal for low-carbon steel, medium-carbon steel, and alloy structural steels—A Case Study Guide for Fault Diagnosi s and Maintenance of Mechanical and Electrical Systems. 38 And stainless steel. Arc surfacing under a flux layer is suitable for low-carbon and medium-carbon steels. Chrome plating  technology works well with carbon structural steels, alloy structural steels, stainless steels, and gray cast iron. Bonded repair methods can firmly join parts made of various met allic and non-metallic materials. Spray coating has a broad applicability—almost any type of metal part, including carbon steel, alloy steel, cast iron components, and the vast maj ority of non-ferrous metal parts, can be coated. However, among metals, only a few non-ferrous materials pose challenges for spraying, such as pure copper; additionally, materials  primarily composed of tungsten or molybdenum are also difficult to coat effectively. (2) Consider the patching layer thicknesses that each repair technique can provide. Since the d egree of wear varies across different parts, the required thickness of the repair layer to compensate for wear will also differ. Therefore, when selecting a repair technique, it’s  important to understand the maximum patching layer thickness achievable by each method."

2. Installation of Integral Sliding Bearings (1) Press-fit the sleeve. When the sleeve dimensions and interference fit are relatively small, a press-fitting method can be used—installing the sleeve by applying pressure with a press or gently tapping it into place using a hardwood block. For larger dimensions and interference fits, or when installing thin-walled sleeves, the thermal expansion method is recommended: cool the sleeve in dry ice or liquid nitrogen before fitting it into the bearing housing. During the press-fitting process, ensure that the mating surfaces are clean and apply a thin layer of lubricant to prevent the sleeve from becoming skewed. (2) Sleeve positioning. After pressing the sleeve into place, its position should be secured using the fastening screws or locating pins as specified in the drawing, to prevent the sleeve from rotating along with the shaft. The method for fixing the sleeve is shown in Figure 2.4. Figure 2.4: Method of Shaft Sleeve Fixation (3) Bore the bushing hole. After the bushing is press-fitted, the interference fit on the outer wall may cause the inner bore to shrink or deform. Therefore, reaming or scraping should be performed to ensure that the contact points between the bushing and the journal meet the specified standards. 3. Diagnosis and Maintenance of Sliding Bearings 1) The contact angle of the plain bearing bush does not meet the requirements. (1) Phenomenon: The contact angle between the bearing bush and the journal does not meet the standard requirements. (2) Cause analysis: Failure to follow the operational guidelines strictly during scraping, careless work practices, and weak foundational skills in the relevant techniques. (3) Harmfulness. If the contact angle between the bearing bush and the journal is too large, it becomes difficult for a lubricating oil film to form, resulting in inadequate lubrication. As a result, bearing wear is accelerated. If the contact angle is too small, it increases the pressure on the bearing, which in turn leads to rapid wear of the bearing as well. (4) Prevention and Control Measures: The contact angle between the bearing bush and the journal should be appropriately sized, typically maintained between 60° and 90°. For high-speed, low-load applications, The bearing contact angle can be set at 60°, while for low-speed, heavy-duty bearings, a contact angle of 90° is recommended. Babbitt metal scraping should be performed only after the equipment has been precisely leveled. The scraping process involves two key areas: first, scraping the contact surface between the babbitt backing (babbitt back) and the bearing housing; and second, scraping the contact area between the babbitt lining and the journal. The scraping and lapping of the bearing shell with the bearing housing should also not be overlooked. Specific requirements are as follows: the contact area between the lower bearing shell and the bearing seat must be at least 50% of the total surface area, while the contact area between the upper bearing shell and the bearing cap should be no less than 40%. Additionally, the contact points between the bearing shells and both the bearing housing and bearing cap should ideally consist of 1 to 2 points per cm². If the contact area is too small or the number of contact points is insufficient, it will cause the bearing bush to... Increased pressure per unit area accelerates the wear of the bearing bushing. When scraping the bearing bushing, all components on the shaft should be fully assembled. Typically, scraping begins with the lower half of the bushing before moving to the upper half. During the scraping process, a thin layer of red lead oil can be applied to the journal, and the journal is gently inserted into the bushing. Then, the shaft is rotated—first in one direction, then in the opposite—to ensure even contact across both halves of the bushing. This allows the bushing and journal to rub against each other. Afterward, the shaft is carefully lifted, and based on the condition of the scraped surface, it’s determined whether the contact angle and contact points meet the specified requirements. If they don’t, further adjustments using additional steps are necessary."

(2) Cause analysis: Excessive or insufficient lubricating oil inside the bearing, or even complete absence of oil; impure lubricant can also lead to bearing overheating; and improper bearing assembly (such as misalignment, skewing, or lack of clearance). (3) Hazardous Effects: The materials used for bearings typically have lower strength and hardness compared to the materials used for shafts (e.g., in sliding bearings). When bearings overheat, this can lead to wear of the bearing alloy—under severe conditions, the alloy may even melt, causing the machinery to come to a halt. For rolling bearings, overheating also accelerates wear, significantly reducing their service life. (4) Prevention and Control Measures. First, thoroughly clean the lubrication system, then add the appropriate lubricant—selected according to the specified grade and quantity—as per the design requirements.
28 Determine the form and compensation method for the error compensation环节, ensuring assembly accuracy among all components—such as parallelism, coaxiality, perpendicularity, and the required meshing precision of the transmission. 3) Post-Repair Acceptance Phase All equipment that has undergone repair, assembly, and adjustment must be subjected to comprehensive precision checks and tests—such as geometric accuracy inspections, no-load running tests, load tests, and working precision evaluations—in accordance with the relevant prescribed accuracy standards or the precision criteria established prior to repair. These measures ensure a thorough assessment of the repaired equipment’s quality, restored precision, and overall performance. After equipment maintenance, record the modifications made to the original technical documentation and document any lessons learned during the repair process. Prepare a thorough post-repair summary and file it alongside the original documents for future reference during the next maintenance task. 2. Determining the Equipment Maintenance Plan Major equipment overhauls must not only meet the predetermined technical requirements but also strive to enhance economic efficiency. Therefore, before starting repairs, it’s essential to thoroughly assess the equipment’s technical condition, develop a practical and feasible repair plan, and ensure comprehensive preparation—both technically and in terms of production readiness. During the repair process, actively incorporate new technologies, materials, processes, and modern management techniques, while diligently managing technical, financial, and organizational aspects to guarantee high-quality workmanship, minimize downtime, and reduce overall maintenance costs. A pre-inspection must be conducted to thoroughly assess the equipment's technical condition before repairs, identify the main defects present, and analyze the product-specific process requirements that influence the equipment's technical specifications—allowing for the immediate development of a repair plan. 3. Technical Preparation Before Equipment Maintenance Preparation for equipment maintenance involves two key aspects: technical preparation and production readiness. The technical preparation prior to maintenance is the responsibility of the lead technician, and its main tasks include pre-inspection planning and research, conducting the actual pre-inspection, and preparing comprehensive overhaul technical documentation. Meanwhile, production readiness before the overhaul is managed by personnel responsible for spare parts, materials, and tools, as well as the production planners from the maintenance unit. Their primary responsibilities encompass ordering, manufacturing, inspecting, and storing critical materials, spare parts, and specialized tools, gauges, and testing equipment—along with developing the overall maintenance production schedule. Pre-inspection survey preparation work To gain a comprehensive understanding of the specific condition of equipment degradation, schedule a shutdown inspection before the major overhaul—this is referred to as a pre-inspection. Before conducting the equipment pre-inspection, ensure the following preparatory investigations are completed. (1) Review the following equipment records: factory inspection reports; precision and performance verification records from equipment installation acceptance tests; details of all past equipment incidents, malfunctions, and repairs, including any remaining issues after repairs; records of all previous maintenance activities, including replaced or repaired components, as well as any unresolved problems left behind after servicing; and operational status monitoring logs and comprehensive equipment inspection records.
7) Machine Tool Operation Test (1) The main drive mechanism of the machine tool should be started from the lowest speed and run sequentially through each gear stage, with each speed level maintained for at least 2 minutes. The highest speed should be run continuously for no less than 30 minutes, ensuring that the spindle bearings reach a stable temperature. For machine tools equipped with change gears, belt-driven variable-speed systems, or stepless transmissions, low-, medium-, and high-speed gear-shifting operations must also be performed. (2) When the spindle bearing reaches a stable temperature, check its temperature and temperature rise—these must not exceed the limits specified in Table 1.4.
② Repai r procedures and work steps, including operational guidelines for each step and the corresponding technical requirements to be achieved. A Tutorial on Diagnostics and Maintenance C ases for Mechatronic Systems 52 ③ Process specification requirements during the repair process. ④ Equipment, fixtures, tools, measuring instruments, and other materials used during  the repair process, as well as the inspection procedures following the repair. Detailed and standardized repair processes and adjustment methods should also be established for the  maintenance of critical, precision components, ensuring the quality of repairs. (4) Repair and Assembly Processes. The main contents of the repair and assembly process specificati ons include preparation for repair and assembly, the sequence for assembling components during repair and overall assembly, repair and assembly methods, analysis of repair dimensio n chains, adjustment and compensation techniques for ensuring repair assembly accuracy, as well as inspection methods. Additionally, the procedures cover inspection and test runs a fter repair and assembly. (5) Employ advanced maintenance techniques. In equipment repair, actively learn cutting-edge maintenance processes and technologies from both domestic and  international sources. Based on the actual conditions of your enterprise, adopt relatively mature new processes and materials to gradually replace outdated techniques. Develop systems and measures for learning, researching, testing, and implementing advanced maintenance technologies, continuously enhancing the company's equipment repair expertise and process capabilities. 3. Quality Management of Equipment Maintenance To ensure the quality of equipment maintenance, quality management should be implemented for equipment repairs. 1) The content of equipment maintenance and quality management (1) Establish quality standards for equipment maintenance. (2) Develop equipment maintenance procedures. (3) Inspection and evaluation of equipment maintenance quality. (4) Strengt hen quality management during the maintenance process. Establish quality control points for critical procedures and encourage participation in grassroots quality management team ac tivities, ensuring thorough implementation of the maintenance process plan. (5) Conduct post-repair customer service and quality feedback activities. (6) Strengthen technical train ing efforts to enhance both technical and managerial skills. 2) Inspection of Equipment Repair Quality Enterprises should establish organizations and assign personnel responsible f or inspecting and evaluating the quality of equipment maintenance. The main aspects of equipment maintenance quality inspection include: ① incoming inspection of purchased spare pa rts and materials; ② process quality control and final inspection of self-made spare parts and repaired components; ③ quality checks on components and assemblies during the equipme nt repair process; ④ visual inspection, trial runs, accuracy assessments, and performance tests conducted after repairs are completed. 3) Quality Assurance System for Equipment Mai ntenance The planning, management, spare parts handling, production oversight, technical administration, financial control, and supply of maintenance materials for equipment repair  form an integrated whole. By effectively organizing and coordinating these various aspects of management, we can establish robust systems—complete with management regulations, ope rational standards, workflow processes, and performance evaluation methods—ultimately creating a comprehensive quality assurance system for equipment maintenance. This ensures high -quality repairs while continuously enhancing our overall maintenance expertise. 1.5.5 Spare Parts Management The process by which enterprises, based on economic and practical prin ciples, determine standard limits for spare parts inventory—such as the quantity of spares to keep in stock, the amount of capital allocated to inventory, and the optimal reserve d uration—after gathering relevant data and conducting both calculations and real-world statistical analysis, is known as  ""reserve quotas. "" Effective spare parts inventory control requires establishing these precise reserve quotas. There is a wide variety of maintenance spare parts, and the prices, demand, inventory  levels, and stockholding durations of these parts vary significantly. Different inventory control methods should be applied to spare parts of varying types and characteristics, as  inventory management must also focus on key priorities. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance 53 The ABC analysis categoriz es inventory spare parts into 3 classes. (1) Class A Spare Parts. Class A spare parts are a small but critical subset of components, characterized by their high importance, challen ging procurement and manufacturing processes, elevated costs, and extended lead times for stockpiling. Although these parts account for approximately 10% of all spare part types, t hey consume around 80% of the total budget allocated to spare parts. Therefore, Class A items require stringent control measures. Employing inventory theory, carefully determine op timal stock levels and ordering schedules, while maintaining minimal safety stock levels. Additionally, strive to reduce order cycles by increasing the frequency of purchases, ther eby accelerating the turnover of spare parts inventory funds. In warehouse management, ensure meticulous recording of all incoming and outgoing spare parts, conduct thorough statis tical analysis and calculations of inventory levels, and rigorously implement preventive measures to protect components against corrosion and rust. (2) Category B spare parts. Thes e have a wider variety than Category A spare parts, accounting for about 25% of the total product range, but they require less capital investment—typically around 15% of the total  funds allocated to spare parts. Category B spare parts usually maintain a higher safety stock level, though their reserves can be managed more flexibly. Additionally, based on main tenance needs, the ordering cycle can be appropriately extended to reduce the frequency of purchases. (3) Category C spare parts. These account for approximately 65% of all part va rieties but represent only about 5% of the total funds allocated to spare parts. For Category C items, inventory levels can be maintained at a slightly higher level based on mainte nance needs, and order lead times can be extended accordingly. The focus of spare parts management should be placed on managing Class A and Class B spare parts.
1) Verify the fault symptoms or signs Given the complexity and subtlety of hydraulic system failures, it is essential to first verify the specific symptoms or signs of the malfunction. This can be done by asking operators and maintenance personnel about recent changes in the machine’s performance, its maintenance history, any specific actions taken after the initial failure signs appeared, and the components that have already been inspected and adjusted. 2) Identify fault diagnosis parameters Hydraulic system failures are all classified as parameter-based faults, and useful fault information is extracted by measuring relevant parameters. Diagnostic parameters for hydraulic systems include system pressure, system flow rate, component temperature rise, component leakage, system vibration and noise, as well as motor speed. When selecting diagnostic parameters, the following principles should be followed: the parameters must exhibit high sensitivity, ease of measurement, and good reproducibility, while also being capable of capturing as much fault-related information as possible. 3) Analyze and determine the possible location and extent of the fault. Analyze the detected results by referring to the hydraulic system schematic, examining both the structural and system principles to ensure accurate fault diagnosis and minimize misdiagnoses. 4) Develop a rational diagnostic process and diagnostic methods Select instruments and meters for diagnostic use The diagnostic instruments and equipment include photoelectric digital tachometers, thermometers, stopwatches, pressure gauges, hydraulic testers, various types of connectors, specialized tools, and more. The selection principle is as follows: First, choose instruments that do not require any disassembly of system components; second, opt for instruments that need to be connected directly into the system; and finally, use hydraulic measuring devices. In cases where the fault is particularly complex, a hydraulic tester can also be used initially for diagnosis. It’s crucial to note that before analyzing and identifying the exact location and extent of the failure, absolutely avoid any unnecessary disassembly, dismantling, or unauthorized adjustments of hydraulic components. Doing so could inadvertently worsen the problem, introduce new issues, or even complicate the original fault further.

3) Bearing overheating (1) Phenomenon: During equipment trial operation, bearing temperatures gradually increased, exceeding the specified requirements. (2) Cause analysis: Excessive or insufficient lubricating oil inside the bearing, or even complete absence of oil; impure lubricant can also lead to bearing overheating; and improper bearing assembly (such as misalignment, skewing, or lack of clearance). (3) Hazardous Effects: The materials used for bearings typically have lower strength and hardness compared to the materials used for shafts (e.g., in sliding bearings). When bearings overheat, this can lead to wear of the bearing alloy—under severe conditions, the alloy may even melt, causing the machinery to come to a halt. For rolling bearings, overheating also accelerates wear, significantly reducing their service life. (4) Prevention and Control Measures. First, thoroughly clean the lubrication system, then add the appropriate lubricant—selected according to the specified grade and quantity—as per the design requirements.

Faults in Three-Phase Induction Motors During Operation and Their Main Causes While in operation, the motor should be regularly inspected to promptly identify and address any faults—otherwise, these issues could lead to accidents. Below are the most common failures and their underlying causes. 1) Mechanical failure (1) Overheating of the bearing. This may be caused by insufficient or excessive grease, shaft misalignment, excessive shaft friction, impurities and foreign objects in the grease, or damage to the steel balls, among other reasons.
4) Shaft Heating (1) Phenomenon: The transmission shaft heats up during operation. (2) Cause analysis. On one hand, the oil-seal pad or rubber ring on the shaft is too tight, causing heat generation due to friction during rotation. On the other hand, the clearance between the bearing cap and the shaft varies unevenly around the circumference, leading to shaft abrasion and, consequently, shaft heating. (3) Hazardous Effects. When the shaft's temperature rises, it reduces the shaft's hardness, accelerates wear, and also leads to damage in other components connected to the shaft. (4) Prevention and Control Measures: Replace the spring inside the rubber ring with a looser one, or loosen the bearing cap screws. Also, check whether the clearance between the bearing cap and the shaft complies with the specifications outlined in the equipment’s technical documentation. If it does not meet the requirements, make sure to adjust it carefully."

1.2 Basics of Equipment Maintenance 1.2.1 Maintenance Method The method of equipment maintenance carries the meaning of a maintenance strategy. Modern equipment management emphasizes applying different maintenance approaches to various types of equipment, underscoring that equipment repair should align with the objective principles governing the physical lifecycle of machinery and materials. This approach ensures production continuity while optimizing the efficient use of maintenance resources, ultimately achieving the most cost-effective outcome over the equipment's entire lifespan. Commonly used maintenance methods for electromechanical equipment include the following: Reactive Maintenance Post-failure maintenance, also known as breakdown maintenance, damage repair, or unplanned maintenance, refers to repairs carried out after mechanical and electrical equipment has malfunctioned—essentially, ""if it breaks, we fix it."" For certain critical equipment, post-failure maintenance should be minimized whenever possible; however, for devices that have minimal impact on production or are backed up by redundant units, opting for post-failure maintenance is often the most cost-effective approach. Preventive Maintenance Maintenance performed before mechanical and electrical equipment fails is called preventive maintenance. Its main benefits include reducing unexpected equipment failures, ensuring continuous production, integrating equipment upkeep and repair tasks into a structured plan—thereby minimizing unplanned disruptions in production—and ultimately improving equipment utilization, lowering maintenance costs, and extending the equipment's natural lifespan. Preventive maintenance is categorized into two basic forms: Regular maintenance Regular maintenance is also known as planned maintenance or time-based preventive maintenance. It involves carrying out preventive maintenance activities at predetermined intervals and follows a cyclical pattern. This type of maintenance is based on the wear patterns of components, with specific guidelines for setting maintenance intervals, defining maintenance categories, outlining maintenance tasks, and estimating the associated workload. However, this approach to maintenance can lead to certain challenges: First, when equipment is still in good technical condition and fully capable of continuing operation, it may undergo major over-maintenance simply because the scheduled interval has arrived—resulting in unnecessary repairs. Second, if a machine’s technical condition has already deteriorated to the point where it can no longer meet production requirements, but the prescribed maintenance interval hasn’t yet been reached, no repair plan will be implemented, leading to under-maintenance. This method is particularly well-suited for process-oriented production equipment or power systems where the wear patterns are well understood, and operations are stable and contin uous—such as large-scale assembly line equipment or key machinery operating on automated production lines. Currently, China primarily implements two main types of equipment mainten ance systems: the Planned Preventive Maintenance System and the Planned Warranty System. (1) Planned Preventive Maintenance System (referred to as Planned Pre-Maintenance). This sy stem involves maintaining, inspecting, and repairing equipment according to its wear patterns, adhering to predetermined maintenance cycles and procedures, to ensure that the equip ment consistently remains in optimal technical condition. Its key features are outlined below. ① Perform daily cleaning, inspection, lubrication, tightening, and adjustments on equ ipment as required to minimize wear and ensure proper operation. ② Conduct regular inspections and adjustments of the equipment's operational status and wear levels according to th e prescribed schedule, ensuring that potential issues are promptly addressed. This allows you to monitor changes in the equipment's technical condition and adequately prepare the n ecessary resources for scheduled maintenance. ③ Conduct preventive maintenance on equipment in a planned and prepared manner. (2) The Planned Maintenance System (also known as the  Maintenance and Repair System) is a equipment maintenance approach that combines routine upkeep with scheduled inspections and repairs. Its key features are outlined below. ① Based  on the equipment's characteristics and condition, different maintenance categories and intervals are specified according to operational hours (such as production output and mileag e).
① Ensure proper installation to prevent the development of additional stress and vibration. For critical components, avoid dents and scratches, as even the smallest damage could become a potential fracture point. ② Care should be taken to protect the equipment's operating environment, preventing erosion from corrosive media and avoiding excessive temperature differences between its various components. ③ To prevent equipment overload, strictly follow the equipment operating procedures. ④ Take timely corrective measures for parts with cracks.
1.4.1 Preparations Before Mechanical Equipment Maintenance Electromechanical equipment occupies a critically important position in the production and operational activities of modern industrial enterprises. To ensure smooth equipment operation and safe production, implementing planned preventive maintenance is an essential component of equipment management and repair practices in industrial companies. This section will cover the detailed process of major equipment overhauls, the determination of equipment repair plans, as well as the technical and material preparations required prior to equipment maintenance. 1. Equipment Major Overhaul Process To ensure the precision and operational performance of mechanical and electrical equipment, preventive scheduled maintenance must be carried out in addition to routine upkeep. Among these preventive measures, major overhauls stand out as a critical task aimed at restoring the equipment's accuracy. Within the category of preventive maintenance, major overhauls—often referred to simply as ""overhauls""—represent the most extensive and time-consuming type of repair. An overhaul involves completely or largely disassembling the equipment, repairing or replacing foundational components, refurbishing mechanical and electrical parts, recalibrating the electrical systems, and finally reassembling and fine-tuning the entire unit. The ultimate goal is to thoroughly eliminate any pre-existing defects and restore the equipment to its specified performance standards. The purpose of precision and performance. The major steps involved in the overhaul of mechanical and electrical equipment typically include: pre-disassembly unit inspection, component removal, component inspection, necessary component disassembly, parts cleaning and examination, component repair and assembly, final assembly, no-load trial operation, load testing, overall machine precision verification, and final acceptance. In practice, these tasks should be carried out according to the overhaul work plan, while also ensuring effective job scheduling, quality control during operations, and thorough completion acceptance. The major overhaul process for mechanical and electrical equipment is typically divided into three stages: pre-repair preparation, the repair process itself, and post-repair acceptance. Pre-repair preparation phase To ensure the repair work proceeds smoothly and accurately, maintenance personnel should carefully listen to operators' requirements for equipment repairs and thoroughly understand the issues affecting the equipment being serviced—such as loss of precision, the extent of wear on major mechanical components, the accuracy of the transmission system, and any visible defects. They should also identify which parts need improvement or modification to meet the equipment’s operational specifications. Additionally, they should review relevant technical documentation, equipment manuals, and previous maintenance records to become familiar with the device’s structural features, transmission system, and original design precision standards. This preparation will enable them to propose comprehensive pre-inspection tasks. Following the pre-inspection, specific repair methods for critical and large components can be determined, allowing for the preparation of specialized tools and precision measuring instruments. Finally, the team must define the post-repair precision testing procedures and establish clear acceptance criteria for trial runs, ensuring all technical preparations are fully in place before proceeding with the complete overhaul of the equipment.

How to disassemble shaft-type parts? What are the specific requirements for installing sliding bearings? What are the common failures of plain bearings? What are the associated hazards, and how can they be prevented? How to disassemble a rolling bearing? How to assemble it? What are the failure modes of gears?
The main factors influencing rolling bearing failure include load conditions, lubrication, assembly practices, environmental factors, and material quality or manufacturing precision. When determining bearing dimensions, it's essential to perform the necessary calculations tailored to the primary failure modes. For rotating rolling bearings under typical operating conditions, both contact fatigue life and static strength analyses are usually required. In contrast, for oscillating or low-speed bearings, only a static strength calculation is sufficient. Meanwhile, high-speed bearings are prone to adhesive wear and scoring caused by heat generation, making these failure modes their main concerns. Therefore, in addition to conducting life calculations, it’s also crucial to verify the bearing’s limiting speed. 2.4.3 Disassembly, Cleaning, and Inspection of Rolling Bearings
Rolling bearing: 70°C vs. 40°C (3) The machine tool's feed mechanism should undergo no-load tests at low, medium, and high feed speeds, while the rapid traverse mechanism should be tested under no-load conditions at its maximum rapid-speed setting. (4) During the machine tool's operational test, all mechanisms undergo startup, stopping, braking, automatic motion, gear-shift transitions, and rapid movements. All should be flexible and reliable. (5) All hydraulic, lubrication, and cooling systems must be free of leaks. (6) The pneumatic system and piping must not have any air leaks. (7) The machine tool's safety guards and protective devices must be complete, secure, and function reliably and sensitively. (8) The machine tool's accuracy must be checked both before and after the load test. For machine tools that do not undergo a load test, accuracy verification should be performed after the no-load running test. 2. Precision Inspection of Mechanical Equipment Maintenance After major overhauls of mechanical equipment, acceptance checks are conducted according to established standards, with each type of equipment having its own specific acceptance criteria and inspection methods. Take metal cutting machine tools as an example: the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has established various precision testing standards for different types of machine tools, along with general guidelines for machine tool accuracy verification. Similarly, China has developed its own standards that are either equivalent to or closely aligned with international benchmarks. These standards specify the inspection items, criteria, methods, and tolerances for machine tool accuracy—serving as the fundamental basis for conducting precision tests. Currently, machine tool maintenance is carried out based on both geometric and operational precision standards during acceptance procedures. Inspection of Machine Tool Geometric Accuracy Geometric accuracy of machine tools refers to the precision of the components that ultimately affect the machine's operational accuracy. It encompasses individual accuracies of basic structural elements, positional accuracy between various parts, as well as motion accuracy, positioning accuracy, indexing accuracy, and transmission chain accuracy. Typically, geometric accuracy checks are performed while the machine tool is stationary. Before conducting these inspections, it’s essential to first ensure proper installation and leveling. Follow the machine tool’s instruction manual carefully to install the equipment on a suitable foundation and achieve precise leveling. The primary goal of leveling is to guarantee the machine’s static stability, which facilitates accurate measurements during testing—especially those related to the straightness of machine components. Additionally, national standards have standardized methods for inspecting both geometric and operational accuracy of machine tools, providing a reliable reference for conducting geometric accuracy tests. Machine Tool Testing Since the geometric accuracy of machine tools is checked under static conditions, it cannot fully reflect the quality of machine tool maintenance. To determine  whether a machine tool can maintain its original geometric accuracy under operational conditions and load applications, it must be evaluated through various machine tool tests. Th e key components of machine tool maintenance testing include no-load running tests, load tests, and working precision tests. (1) No-load operation test of the machine tool. The pur pose of the no-load operation test is to further verify the correct functioning of each component of the machine tool. Sex, reliability, ease and normality of operation, as well as  whether the temperature rise and noise levels of each moving component are within acceptable limits. The primary focus of the machine tool's no-load running test is to simultaneou sly check the operational status of relevant parts while testing the spindle and feed speeds. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Mai ntenance 35 Before conducting the no-load operation test of the machine tool, ensure that all major overhaul tasks have been completed and that each repair has met the required qua lity standards. Next, fill all oil reservoirs with lubricant and properly grease all lubrication points. It is crucial to note: Only after completing all necessary preparations in  accordance with the safety operating procedures can you proceed with the no-load tests as outlined by the precision inspection standards specific to the machine tool being used. (2 ) Machine Tool Load Testing. The machine tool load test evaluates whether the machine’s main motion system can achieve the maximum torque and power allowed by the design, as well a s checks if all machine components are functioning properly under these conditions, whether there are any positional changes between parts, and if such changes remain within the pe rmissible limits. Additionally, it ensures that vibrations, noise levels, and temperature rise remain within normal operating ranges. The machine tool load test primarily involves  performing a cutting-load test, where tools and cutting parameters are selected according to specified requirements to machine the surface of test specimens made from a particular  material and in a specific size. During the load test, the spindle speed and feed rate are allowed to deviate by no more than 5% compared to the theoretical values. (3) Machine Too l Working Accuracy Test. The purpose of the machine tool working accuracy test is to determine whether the positional accuracy between the machine’s various components during the m achining process meets the precision requirements of the parts being manufactured. Before the test, its geometric accuracy must be rechecked. The machine tool working accuracy test  involves machining the surface of a specified test piece using cutting tools and appropriate cutting parameters, as outlined in the machine tool accuracy testing standards for wor king precision requirements. The geometric accuracy of the machined workpiece surface must fall within the tolerance range specified by the precision standards of the machine tool  used, and the surface roughness value should not exceed the prescribed standard.
General Principles for Disassembly (1) Based on the structural characteristics of the mechanical equipment, select a logical disassembly sequence. Typically, the process involves dismantling from the overall unit into subassemblies, then breaking down subassemblies into individual components, and finally separating components into their constituent parts—or alternatively, proceeding from accessories to the main unit and from external elements inward. When disassembling particularly complex components, it’s essential to thoroughly study the assembly drawings and carefully analyze the component’s structure as well as the specific roles its parts play within the assembly. Pay special attention to components that require high precision during assembly. This approach helps prevent confusion, ensures an orderly disassembly process, and ultimately facilitates cleaning, inspection, and identification—laying a solid foundation for effective maintenance work. (2) Rational disassembly. During the maintenance and disassembly of mechanical equipment, adhere to the principle of avoiding unnecessary disassembly while ensuring that components requiring removal are indeed taken apart. (3) Use disassembly tools and equipment correctly. After understanding the steps involved in removing mechanical components, it’s crucial to select and properly apply the appropriate disassembly tools. When dismantling, always opt for specialized or suitably matched tools and equipment whenever possible, avoiding random hammering or forceful techniques to prevent damage or deformation of the parts. For instance, when removing shaft sleeves, rolling bearings, gears, pulleys, and similar components, use pullers or hydraulic presses; and for unscrewing studs or nuts, always prefer wrenches that match their dimensions precisely. Precautions During Disassembly: When performing mechanical equipment maintenance, disassembly should also take into account the subsequent assembly tasks. To ensure a smooth process, keep the following points in mind. (1) Ensure thorough verification or marking of disassembled parts. Mechanical equipment often contains numerous precisely matched components and parts, many of which have been specifically selected or balanced for weight—meaning their assembly positions and orientations must not be altered under any circumstances. Therefore, when dismantling, carefully check parts that already bear original markings. If these markings are unclear, misaligned, or missing altogether, re-mark them exactly as they were originally to ensure proper alignment during reassembly, preventing any confusion or errors. (2) Store parts by category. When storing disassembled parts, follow these principles: Parts belonging to the same type or component should be kept together whenever possible; store items according to their size and precision level; non-interchangeable parts must be stored separately in groups; delicate components that are sensitive to dirt or damage should be removed and stored individually; rubber parts should never be stored alongside oil-bearing components; and ensure that easily lost items are carefully accounted for. Parts such as washers and nuts should be strung together with wire or stored in dedicated containers; all types of studs must be fitted with nuts before being placed in storage. Additionally, parts like steel components, aluminum items, rubber pieces, and leather goods should be stored separately in different containers, categorized by their respective material types. (3) Protect the machined surfaces of removed parts. During disassembly, never damage the machined surfaces of the components being taken apart—doing so could complicate repair work and lead to issues such as air, oil, or water leaks, ultimately resulting in reduced performance of the mechanical equipment. 1.4.4 Disassembly Methods for Commonly Used Components The disassembly of commonly used components should follow general disassembly principles, while also considering their specific characteristics and employing appropriate methods tailored to each component in order to achieve the intended purpose. 1. Disassembly of the Spindle Assembly To prevent reduced assembly accuracy due to improper disassembly, mark the relative positions of bearings, washers, tool housings, and spindles around the circumference during removal. After disassembling, group each bearing along with its corresponding inner and outer washers separately and store them in distinct locations—do not mix them up. Ensure that the workbench and surrounding area at the disassembly site remain clean, and immediately place all removed parts into oil to prevent rusting. When reassembling, be sure to reinstall them according to their original marked orientations. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment"

Fit of Rolling Bearings The bearing fit refers to the mating between the inner ring and the journal, as well as the outer ring and the housing, influencing the bearing's radial clearance, operational accuracy, and service life. Rolling bearings are standard components, and the fit between the bearing bore and the shaft follows the hole basis system, while the fit between the outer ring and the bearing housing uses the shaft basis system. Since the tolerance zone for the bearing inner diameter lies below the zero line, whereas in cylindrical tolerance standards, the tolerance zone for the reference hole is above the zero line, the interference fit between the inner ring and the journal is significantly tighter than the corresponding hole-basis fits specified in cylindrical tolerance standards. Figures 2.6 and 2.7 illustrate the fit of rolling bearings and their relationship to deviations in the dimensions of the journal or housing bore relative to the bearing’s reference surfaces (inner ring inner diameter, outer ring outer diameter). When designing, the type and size of the bearing, as well as the magnitude of the load, should guide the selection of the appropriate fit. For applications with large dimensions, heavy loads, significant vibrations, high rotational speeds, or elevated operating temperatures, a tighter fit is recommended. However, excessively tight fits can impair the bearing’s proper function and also make assembly and disassembly more challenging. On the other hand, for components that require frequent removal or where the raceways experience movement, a looser fit should be chosen. However, excessive looseness is detrimental to improving bearing rotational accuracy and reducing vibration.

The main factors influencing rolling bearing failure include load conditions, lubrication, assembly practices, environmental factors, and material quality or manufacturing precision. When determining bearing dimensions, it's essential to perform the necessary calculations tailored to the primary failure modes. For rotating rolling bearings under typical operating conditions, both contact fatigue life and static strength analyses are usually required. In contrast, for oscillating or low-speed bearings, only a static strength calculation is sufficient. Meanwhile, high-speed bearings are prone to adhesive wear and scoring caused by heat generation, making these failure modes their main concerns.

How to disassemble a rolling bearing? How to assemble it? When designing bearing assemblies, consider the ease of installation and removal to prevent damage to the bearing and other components during these processes. Bearing installation: Small bearings can be gently and evenly tapped into place using a copper hammer to fit the retaining rings; larger bearings should be pressed in with a hydraulic press. Bearings that are large in size and tightly fitted can be heated to expand the bore before assembly. Bearing installation and removal: Specialized tools can be used; when designing the structure, ensure ease of bearing installation and removal. 1. Disassembling Rolling Bearings Disassembling rolling bearings is an essential part of mechanical maintenance. Since rolling bearings are tightly fitted to the shaft, significant force is required to remove them. If the disassembly method is improper, not only may the bearing fail to come off, but if the fit is particularly tight—with a large interference—the process could also damage the bearing and its associated components. Here, we introduce several commonly used methods for removing bearings. (1) Heating Disassembly Method. If the bearing is tightly fitted and has a significant interference fit, the bearing must be heated to induce thermal expansion, causing elastic deformation that allows for easy removal. For instance, you can wrap the shaft near the bearing with asbestos cloth and then heat the inner race of the bearing using an acetylene-oxygen flame—this method enables disassembly while heating continues. However, it’s crucial to heat slowly, keeping the temperature around 100°C to prevent damage to the bearing. (2) If the bearing has a loose fit, you can carefully tap the fitting ring of the bearing with a wooden mallet to remove it. When tapping, make sure to work evenly around the circumference—avoid focusing on just one spot repeatedly. In some cases, a steel hammer may also be used, but in this scenario, always place a wooden block between the hammer and the bearing to ensure that the force is distributed evenly across the bearing, preventing damage. (3) Select a metal material to create a sleeve, ensuring the inner diameter of the sleeve is slightly larger than the journal diameter. During removal, support the sleeve with an appropriate object. If the fit is loose, gently tap the shaft end with a hammer to detach the bearing; if the fit is tight, apply force to the shaft end using a press or jack. Alternatively, if using the sleeve proves inconvenient, you can also substitute it with two clamping plates. Chapter 2: Fault Diagnosis and Repair of Commonly Used Components 65 (4) Tensioner Disassembly Method. Use a tensioner to remove the shaft. ""Contraction is a commonly used disassembly method; the tension device consists of a pull hook and..."" Threaded transmission assembly. When disassembling, hang the hook on the inner ring.

(5) If the bearing cannot be pulled out using a puller, The ring can simultaneously cool the outer race of the bearing locally using dry ice, yet… Then quickly pull the outer race of the tapered roller bearing out of the gear. 2. Bearing Cleaning (1) Hot Oil Cleaning Method. For bearings hardened by soft dry oil or rust-preventive grease, immerse them in hot motor oil heated to 100–200°C. Use pliers to grip the bearing and gently scrub away any oil contamination with a brush. When heated to 100–200°C, soft dry oil or rust-preventive grease will melt, allowing it to easily flush out of the bearing’s crevices. In some cases, simply shaking the bearing repeatedly in the oil is enough to dislodge the dirt and grime from between the gaps. When cleaning the radial spherical ball bearings of old or imported electric motors, the balls, retainer, and inner ring should be carefully turned horizontally out of the outer ring before being immersed in hot oil. Similarly, when cleaning short cylindrical roller bearings, the rollers, retainer, inner ring, and outer ring must first be separated from one another. When cleaning with hot oil, the oil temperature should not exceed 20°C. If using an open flame for direct heating, be careful to prevent the oil from catching fire. The bearing should be suspended inside the oil pot—immersing it completely at the bottom could cause overheating and reduce its hardness. (2) General Cleaning Method: Place the bearing in kerosene and soak it for 5–10 minutes. While holding the inner ring with one hand, gently rotate the outer ring with the other—this will cause any soft dry grease or rust-preventive paste on the bearing to fall off. Next, transfer the bearing to a container of cleaner kerosene and use a fine, soft-bristled brush to thoroughly clean away oil stains from the raceways and between the rolling elements. Finally, rinse the bearing once more in gasoline before carefully placing it onto a clean piece of paper. When cleaning spherical ball bearings and short cylindrical roller bearings, separate the balls, retainer cage, inner ring, and outer ring for individual cleaning. For bearings already mounted on a shaft, cleaning is typically done by pouring oil directly over them or using an oil gun for targeted spraying. Start with kerosene to remove easily loosened oil deposits, followed by gasoline for tougher residues. If oil stains persist, first apply hot engine oil heated to 100–200°C via pouring or spraying, then finish with gasoline. Always remember not to scrape off hardened oil buildup or rust from the bearing surfaces using sharp tools, as this could damage the smoothness of the rolling elements and raceway grooves. After cleaning, dry the bearing thoroughly with a clean cloth. 3. Inspection of Rolling Bearings For rolling bearings, focus should be placed on inspecting the inner and outer raceways. The entire working surface must be smooth, free from defects such as cracks, micropores, dents, and peeling. Similarly, the surfaces of the rolling elements themselves should be flawless, with no cracks, micropores, or dents. Additionally, the retainer must remain intact, and all rivets should be securely fastened. If clearance is detected between the inner and outer races of the bearing, avoid replacing it immediately—instead, consider adjusting it through preloading to eliminate any increased clearance caused by wear, thereby enhancing its rotational accuracy. 2.4.4 Assembly of Rolling Bearings Rolling bearings consist of an inner ring, outer ring, rolling elements, and a cage—they are the bearing components that enable relative motion between the shaft and the bearing housing through rolling friction. Rolling bearings offer advantages such as low friction coefficients, high efficiency, compact axial dimensions, and ease of assembly and disassembly, making them widely used in various types of machinery and equipment. As standardized components mass-produced by specialized factories, rolling bearings come with predetermined inner diameters, outer diameters, and axial widths at the time of manufacture. Consequently, the inner ring of a rolling bearing serves as the reference hole, while the outer ring acts as the reference shaft.

Removal Method (1) Striking and Disengaging. Striking involves using the force of a hammer to create relative movement between mating parts, allowing them to separate and achieve disassembly. This is a straightforward method suitable for simpler structures or when dealing with robust, non-critical components. When striking, proceed with caution—improper technique could easily damage the parts. Common tools used for this method include steel hammers, copper hammers, wooden mallets, punches, as well as copper, aluminum, and wooden shims. When removing rolling bearings by striking, always tap symmetrically from both sides; never concentrate the blows on just one side, as this could lead to cracking of the bearing raceway. (2) Press and pull disassembly. Press and pull methods are superior to impact disassembly because they apply force more evenly, allowing precise control over both the magnitude and direction of the force. As a result, these techniques reduce the risk of part misalignment or damage. This method is particularly suitable for dismantling larger components or parts with significant interference fits. Commonly used tools for this process include press benches and pull molds. (3) Hot disassembly. Hot disassembly leverages the thermal expansion properties of metals to separate parts, preventing issues like parts getting stuck or damaged—something that can occur with methods like impact or press disassembly. This technique is commonly used when the interference fit is significant (exceeding 0.1 mm), the components are large in size, or traditional disassembly methods prove impractical. In summary, choose the appropriate removal method based on how the parts fit together. If it’s a transition fit, you can use a tapping method. Remove the part; if it’s a press-fit assembly, you can use either press-off or heat-based disassembly methods. After removal, place the parts on a wooden board or a low surface. Chapter 2: Troubleshooting and Repair of Commonly Used Components 57 On the platform; smaller parts such as screws, nuts, washers, pins, and others can be placed in dedicated boxes. Long, slender components like spindles and lead screws can be hung vertically to prevent bending or deformation. Disassembly of spindle components: The relative positions of parts such as the housing and spindle are ensured using an error-compensation method. To prevent improper disassembly that could compromise assembly accuracy, make sure to mark the circumferential positions of bearings, washers, tool housings, and the spindle itself during disassembly. After removal, arrange the bearings and inner/outer washers separately into their respective groups—never mix them up. Additionally, keep the workbench and surrounding area thoroughly clean during disassembly, and immediately immerse removed parts in oil to prevent rusting. When reassembling, be sure to reinstall them precisely according to the original markings. 2.1.3 Cleaning, Inspection, and Repair After Shaft Removal
General Principles for Disassembly (1) Based on the structural characteristics of the mechanical equipment, select a logical disassembly sequence. Typically, the process involves dismantling from the overall unit into subassemblies, then breaking down subassemblies into individual components, and finally separating components into their constituent parts—or alternatively, proceeding from accessories to the main unit and from external elements inward. When disassembling particularly complex components, it’s essential to thoroughly study the assembly drawings and carefully analyze the component’s structure as well as the specific roles its parts play within the assembly. Pay special attention to components that require high precision during assembly. This approach helps prevent confusion, ensures an orderly disassembly process, and ultimately facilitates cleaning, inspection, and identification—laying a solid foundation for effective maintenance work. (2) Rational disassembly. During the maintenance and disassembly of mechanical equipment, adhere to the principle of avoiding unnecessary disassembly while ensuring that components requiring removal are indeed taken apart. (3) Use disassembly tools and equipment correctly. After understanding the steps involved in removing mechanical components, it’s crucial to select and properly apply the appropriate disassembly tools. When dismantling, always opt for specialized or suitably matched tools and equipment whenever possible, avoiding random hammering or forceful techniques to prevent damage or deformation of the parts. For instance, when removing shaft sleeves, rolling bearings, gears, pulleys, and similar components, use pullers or hydraulic presses; and for unscrewing studs or nuts, always prefer wrenches that match their dimensions precisely. Precautions During Disassembly: When performing mechanical equipment maintenance, disassembly should also take into account the subsequent assembly tasks. To ensure a smooth process, keep the following points in mind. (1) Ensure thorough verification or marking of disassembled parts. Mechanical equipment often contains numerous precisely matched components and parts, many of which have been specifically selected or balanced for weight—meaning their assembly positions and orientations must not be altered under any circumstances. Therefore, when dismantling, carefully check parts that already bear original markings. If these markings are unclear, misaligned, or missing altogether, re-mark them exactly as they were originally to ensure proper alignment during reassembly, preventing any confusion or errors. (2) Store parts by category. When storing disassembled parts, follow these principles: Parts belonging to the same type or component should be kept together whenever possible; store items according to their size and precision level; non-interchangeable parts must be stored separately in groups; delicate components that are sensitive to dirt or damage should be removed and stored individually; rubber parts should never be stored alongside oil-bearing components; and ensure that easily lost items are carefully accounted for. Parts such as washers and nuts should be strung together with wire or stored in dedicated containers; all types of studs must be fitted with nuts before being placed in storage. Additionally, parts like steel components, aluminum items, rubber pieces, and leather goods should be stored separately in different containers, categorized by their respective material types. (3) Protect the machined surfaces of removed parts. During disassembly, never damage the machined surfaces of the components being taken apart—doing so could complicate repair work and lead to issues such as air, oil, or water leaks, ultimately resulting in reduced performance of the mechanical equipment. 1.4.4 Disassembly Methods for Commonly Used Components The disassembly of commonly used components should follow general disassembly principles, while also considering their specific characteristics and employing appropriate methods tailored to each component in order to achieve the intended purpose. 1. Disassembly of the Spindle Assembly To prevent reduced assembly accuracy due to improper disassembly, mark the relative positions of bearings, washers, tool housings, and spindles around the circumference during removal. After disassembling, group each bearing along with its corresponding inner and outer washers separately and store them in distinct locations—do not mix them up. Ensure that the workbench and surrounding area at the disassembly site remain clean, and immediately place all removed parts into oil to prevent rusting. When reassembling, be sure to reinstall them according to their original marked orientations. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment"

When designing bearing assemblies, consider the ease of installation and removal to prevent damage to the bearing and other components during these processes. Bearing installation: Small bearings can be gently and evenly tapped into place using a copper hammer to fit the retaining rings; larger bearings should be pressed in with a hydraulic press. Bearings that are large in size and tightly fitted can be heated to expand the bore before assembly. Bearing installation and removal: Specialized tools can be used; when designing the structure, ensure ease of bearing installation and removal. 1. Disassembling Rolling Bearings Disassembling rolling bearings is an essential part of mechanical maintenance. Since rolling bearings are tightly fitted to the shaft, significant force is required to remove them. If the disassembly method is improper, not only may the bearing fail to come off, but if the fit is particularly tight—with a large interference—the process could also damage the bearing and its associated components. Here, we introduce several commonly used methods for removing bearings. (1) Heating Disassembly Method. If the bearing is tightly fitted and has a significant interference fit, the bearing must be heated to induce thermal expansion, causing elastic deformation that allows for easy removal. For instance, you can wrap the shaft near the bearing with asbestos cloth and then heat the inner race of the bearing using an acetylene-oxygen flame—this method enables disassembly while heating continues. However, it’s crucial to heat slowly, keeping the temperature around 100°C to prevent damage to the bearing. (2) If the bearing has a loose fit, you can carefully tap the fitting ring of the bearing with a wooden mallet to remove it. When tapping, make sure to work evenly around the circumference—avoid focusing on just one spot repeatedly. In some cases, a steel hammer may also be used, but in this scenario, always place a wooden block between the hammer and the bearing to ensure that the force is distributed evenly across the bearing, preventing damage. (3) Select a metal material to create a sleeve, ensuring the inner diameter of the sleeve is slightly larger than the journal diameter. During removal, support the sleeve with an appropriate object. If the fit is loose, gently tap the shaft end with a hammer to detach the bearing; if the fit is tight, apply force to the shaft end using a press or jack. Alternatively, if using the sleeve proves inconvenient, you can also substitute it with two clamping plates.

Context:  
The main factors influencing rolling bearing failure include load conditions, lubrication, assembly practices, environmental factors, and material quality or manufacturing precision. When determining bearing dimensions, it's essential to perform the necessary calculations tailored to the primary failure modes. For rotating rolling bearings under typical operating conditions, both contact fatigue life and static strength analyses are usually required. In contrast, for oscillating or low-speed bearings, only a static strength calculation is sufficient. Meanwhile, high-speed bearings are prone to adhesive wear and scoring caused by heat generation, making these failure modes their main concerns. Therefore, in addition to conducting life calculations, it’s also crucial to verify the bearing’s limiting speed. 2.4.3 Disassembly, Cleaning, and Inspection of Rolling Bearings
28 Determine the form and compensation method for the error compensation环节, ensuring assembly accuracy among all components—such as parallelism, coaxiality, perpendicularity, and the required meshing precision of the transmission. 3) Post-Repair Acceptance Phase All equipment that has undergone repair, assembly, and adjustment must be subjected to comprehensive precision checks and tests—such as geometric accuracy inspections, no-load running tests, load tests, and working precision evaluations—in accordance with the relevant prescribed accuracy standards or the precision criteria established prior to repair. These measures ensure a thorough assessment of the repaired equipment’s quality, restored precision, and overall performance. After equipment maintenance, record the modifications made to the original technical documentation and document any lessons learned during the repair process. Prepare a thorough post-repair summary and file it alongside the original documents for future reference during the next maintenance task. 2. Determining the Equipment Maintenance Plan Major equipment overhauls must not only meet the predetermined technical requirements but also strive to enhance economic efficiency. Therefore, before starting repairs, it’s essential to thoroughly assess the equipment’s technical condition, develop a practical and feasible repair plan, and ensure comprehensive preparation—both technically and in terms of production readiness. During the repair process, actively incorporate new technologies, materials, processes, and modern management techniques, while diligently managing technical, financial, and organizational aspects to guarantee high-quality workmanship, minimize downtime, and reduce overall maintenance costs. A pre-inspection must be conducted to thoroughly assess the equipment's technical condition before repairs, identify the main defects present, and analyze the product-specific process requirements that influence the equipment's technical specifications—allowing for the immediate development of a repair plan. 3. Technical Preparation Before Equipment Maintenance Preparation for equipment maintenance involves two key aspects: technical preparation and production readiness. The technical preparation prior to maintenance is the responsibility of the lead technician, and its main tasks include pre-inspection planning and research, conducting the actual pre-inspection, and preparing comprehensive overhaul technical documentation. Meanwhile, production readiness before the overhaul is managed by personnel responsible for spare parts, materials, and tools, as well as the production planners from the maintenance unit. Their primary responsibilities encompass ordering, manufacturing, inspecting, and storing critical materials, spare parts, and specialized tools, gauges, and testing equipment—along with developing the overall maintenance production schedule. Pre-inspection survey preparation work To gain a comprehensive understanding of the specific condition of equipment degradation, schedule a shutdown inspection before the major overhaul—this is referred to as a pre-inspection. Before conducting the equipment pre-inspection, ensure the following preparatory investigations are completed. (1) Review the following equipment records: factory inspection reports; precision and performance verification records from equipment installation acceptance tests; details of all past equipment incidents, malfunctions, and repairs, including any remaining issues after repairs; records of all previous maintenance activities, including replaced or repaired components, as well as any unresolved problems left behind after servicing; and operational status monitoring logs and comprehensive equipment inspection records.
(2) Read the equipment manual and equipment catalog. (3) Survey equipment operators and maintenance personnel: Identify parts of the equipment that are prone to failures during operation and the underlying causes; assess the equipment’s precision and overall performance; highlight the major existing defects; and gather specific recommendations for repairs and improvements required during major overhauls. (4) Solicit input from departments such as Technology, Quality, and Production Management regarding localized equipment improvements. Pre-screening (1) The purpose of the pre-inspection. Through pre-inspection, we can comprehensively and thoroughly assess the deterioration of equipment conditions, gain a clearer understanding of how product processes affect the equipment’s precision and performance, thereby identifying which parts need to be replaced or repaired. This information then allows us to create detailed drawings or verify existing ones for these parts, ensuring they meet the requirements for manufacturing and repair work. (2) Pre-inspection content: Typically, the pre-inspection content is determined based on the equipment type and the pre-repair investigation. (3) Inspect geometric and operational accuracy item by item, according to the equipment manufacturer's precision standards and inspection methods for each country or enterprise. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance
(4) For components that need to be heated before removal, the heating temperature should be maintained according to the design specifications or the equipment manufacturer’s instructions. (5) Machine parts are typically cleaned with kerosene, but precision components or rolling bearings must be washed again with gasoline after being thoroughly cleaned with kerosene. (6) All debris such as sediment, sand, or dirty oil inside oil holes and oil passages must be thoroughly removed, and then sealed with wooden plugs—never use cotton yarn or cloth scraps as substitutes for the plugs. (7) After cleaning, mechanical equipment components that cannot be assembled immediately should be properly stored to prevent dust from entering. (8) When assembling equipment components, first inspect the surface shapes and dimensional accuracy of parts relevant to the assembly. Only proceed with assembly after confirming they meet the required specifications.
Types of Rolling Bearings 1) By the direction of the load borne by the bearing or according to the nominal contact angle Category (1) Radial bearings. Radial contact bearings primarily withstand radial loads. Well, some can handle smaller axial loads; angular contact radial bearings. The bearing can simultaneously handle both radial and axial loads. (2) Thrust bearings. Thrust angular contact bearings primarily handle axial loads. The bearing can also handle smaller radial loads; axial thrust bearings, however, are designed only to withstand axial loads. 2) Classified by the shape of the rolling element Rolling bearings can be classified into ball bearings and roller bearings. 3) Classified by Whether the Working Shaft Can Be Centered Rolling bearings can be classified into self-aligning bearings and non-self-aligning bearings. 4) Classification Based on Whether Clearance Can Be Adjusted Rolling bearings can be classified into bearings with adjustable clearance and those with non-adjustable clearance. 3. Selection of Rolling Bearing Types Selection principle: Match bearing characteristics with operating conditions. 1) Type Selection (1) Load conditions. If the bearing is subjected to axial loads, thrust bearings are typically selected; if the load is purely axial, For smaller loads, thrust ball bearings are re commended; if the pure axial load is significant, thrust roller bearings should be chosen. When the bearing is subjected to pure radial loads, deep groove ball bearings, cylindrica l roller bearings, or needle roller bearings are typically used. If the bearing handles both radial and moderate axial loads simultaneously, deep groove ball bearings, angular cont act ball bearings with small contact angles, or tapered roller bearings are suitable options. For situations involving heavier axial loads, angular contact ball bearings with large r contact angles or tapered roller bearings are ideal. Alternatively, a combined design—using both radial and thrust bearings—can be employed, with each type of bearing specificall y handling either the radial or axial load. (2) Rotational speed requirements. When high speed and precise rotation are needed, ball bearings should be used as the preferred option . (3) Self-aligning capability requirement: When the shaft is long (with low rigidity) or has multiple support points and requires bearings with self-aligning features, choose self -aligning bearings. (4) Load-carrying and shock-resistant capabilities. Use roller bearings when dealing with heavy loads or impact loads. (5) Space limitations. Use roller bearing s when radial dimensions are restricted. 1—Inner race; 2—Outer race; 3—Rolling element; 4—Cage Figure 2.5: Structure of a Rolling Bearing"

2.4.5 Clearance in Rolling Bearings and Its Adjustment The clearance in rolling bearings ensures proper operation of the rolling elements, facilitates lubrication, and accommodates thermal expansion. However, the clearance in rolling bearings must not be too large—or too small. If the clearance is excessive, it reduces the number of rolling elements simultaneously bearing the load, increasing the load on each individual element, which in turn shortens the bearing’s lifespan and compromises rotational accuracy, potentially leading to noise and vibration. On the other hand, if the clearance is too tight, it can easily cause overheating and accelerate wear, again negatively impacting the bearing’s longevity. Therefore, adjusting the clearance during bearing installation is an extremely critical task. There are three commonly used methods for adjusting rolling bearing clearance: the shim method, the screw adjustment method, and the combined adjustment method. 2.4.6 Preloading in Rolling Bearing Assembly Preloading refers to applying an axial load to the bearing during installation, inducing a slight pre-deformation between the rolling elements and the inner and outer rings, thereby enabling the bearing to operate with negative clearance. Preloading increases bearing stiffness, enhances rotational accuracy, and extends bearing life. The preload amount should be determined appropriately based on the bearing's load conditions and application requirements. Excessive preload, however, can increase bearing wear and heat generation, ultimately reducing the bearing's service life. Preloading paired angular contact bearings can enhance their operational stiffness. Common methods for controlling preload include adding metal shims, grinding down the raceways, or adjusting the widths of the inner and outer sleeves between the two bearings. 4) Classification Based on Whether Clearance Can Be Adjusted Rolling bearings can be classified into bearings with adjustable clearance and those with non-adjustable clearance."

2.5.1 Characteristics and Applications of Gear Transmission Gear transmission is one of the most commonly used methods of power transmission, relying on the meshing of gear teeth to transfer motion and power. It is characterized by its ability to ensure an accurate transmission ratio, handle a wide range of power and speed levels, achieve high transmission efficiency, maintain a compact design, and offer long service life—though gear transmissions do require relatively high precision in manufacturing and assembly. There are several types of gear transmissions, which can be classified in different ways into straight teeth, helical teeth, and herringbone gear drives. They can also be categorized into cylindrical gears, bevel gears, and rack-and-pinion gear systems, among others. 2.5.2 Failure Modes of Gear Drives and Preventive Measures
The basic requirements for gear transmission are that the installation position must be correct; the tooth side clearance must meet technical specifications; and the contact spot distribution should be uniform and properly positioned. Gear and shaft assemblies are mostly secured using keys. For gears subjected to axial forces, screws and retaining rings are used to prevent axial movement and ensure proper positioning on the shaft. When transmitting high torque, a transition fit with a larger interference fit is often employed to create a tight, static connection—this typically requires either press-fitting or thermal assembly methods. Here are several common types of errors that occur during the assembly of gears and shafts: 1. Loosening of the cylindrical gear shaft bore (1) Phenomenon: The gear and gear shaft are not tightly fitted together. (2) Cause analysis: The inner bore of the gear was machined incorrectly, resulting in a flared shape. (3) H azardous effects: During operation, lateral oscillation occurs, accelerating wear on both the hole and shaft. Additionally, significant vibration during operation leads to low tran smission efficiency. (4) Prevention and control measures: The internal bore of the gear should be re-machined, and the gear should be replaced if necessary.
2. Gear Runout (1) Phen omenon: The gear centerline does not coincide with the shaft centerline. (2) Cause analysis: Significant assembly dimension errors. (3) Hazardous Effects. When the equipment is run ning, radial runout occurs in the gear transmission. Additionally, the meshing tooth sections experience impacts and noise due to the continuous variation in pitch circle diameter.  If the eccentricity of the centerline exceeds a certain limit, jamming may occur, disrupting the smooth operation of the equipment. (4) Prevention and Control Measures: The gear t ransmission system must be assembled correctly, with all necessary inspections and adjustments performed. Special attention should be paid to ensuring proper alignment of the locat ing keys between the shaft and gears, as well as maintaining appropriate tightness. Any existing issues should be carefully addressed through repairs, and if needed, relevant compo nents should be replaced. Chapter 2: Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of General-Purpose Components
3. Gear Misalignment (1) Phenomenon: The gear becomes skewed when assembled on to the shaft. (2) Cause analysis: Rough and careless assembly; excessive dimensional errors in component machining. (3) Hazardous Effects: When gears are improperly aligned during  assembly on the shaft, end-face runout will occur during equipment operation. This leads to uneven loading between meshing gear pairs, resulting in excessive wear. (4) Prevention a nd Control Measures: Reassembly and adjustment should be performed. If the inspection confirms that the issue is indeed caused by excessive machining errors in the gear shaft bore,  the gear should be replaced. 4. Poor Gear Meshing Performance (1) Phenomenon: The gear was not properly seated against the shaft shoulder during assembly. (2) Cause analysis: The  transmission shaft end is too long; the gear lacks sufficient width during machining; the gear is incorrectly assembled. (3) Harmfulness. During gear assembly, the gears were not p roperly seated against the shaft shoulders, resulting in wide contact between the meshing gears along the axial direction. Meanwhile, the remaining portion of the tooth width exper ienced poor meshing, which further increased the load on those specific teeth. (4) Prevention and Control Measures: The position of the gear on the shaft must be accurately assembl ed according to standard requirements. For components with excessive dimensional deviations, necessary adjustments should be made. 5. Abnormal gear transmission (1) Phenomenon: Abn ormal gear transmission and difficult starting. (2) Cause analysis: The gear retaining key is loose; the gear tooth profile is non-standard or damaged; excessive assembly errors in  the gears; too much oil present.
2.5.5 Assembly and Adjustment of Bevel Gears The assembly of a bevel gear transmission mechanism is essentially similar to that of a cylindrical gear transmission mechanism, with the key difference being that the axes of the two gears intersect at the apex of a cone, forming a specified angle. Typically, the geometric position of the bevel gear axes is determined by the machining accuracy of the housing, while axial positioning relies on the back cone of the bevel gear as a reference. During assembly, the back-cone surfaces must align precisely to ensure proper gear alignment. Depending on whether the contact pattern shifts toward the tooth tip or root, the gear positions should be adjusted and repositioned along the axis accordingly. Axial positioning is usually achieved by shims placed between the bearing housings and the housing itself. Since bevel gears are designed for transmitting motion between perpendicular shafts, the machining of the two vertical bearing housing bores in the housing must strictly adhere to the specified technical requirements. 2.5.6 Assembly and Adjustment of Worm Gear Pair The worm gear mechanism is used to transmit motion and power between two perpendicular shafts, with an intersection angle of 90°. Its key transmission characteristics include: a high gear ratio, a compact design, self-locking capability, smooth operation, and low noise—but it suffers from relatively low transmission efficiency, higher friction, and significant heat generation, which limits the power it can handle, typically up to P ≤ 5 kW. The worm wheel gear ring is usually made from more expensive bronze, resulting in higher manufacturing costs, making this mechanism particularly suitable for applications like speed reduction and lifting equipment. Based on the shape of the worm, worm gear drives can be classified into cylindrical worm drives, globoidal worm drives, and bevel worm drives, with cylindrical worms being the most widely used."

What are the common failure phenomena of gears? What are the associated hazards? How can these be prevented?  
Working Conditions Power is transmitted through tooth surface contact, with the two tooth surfaces meshing together in a motion that involves both rolling and sliding. The gear surface is subjected to alternating contact compressive stress and friction forces; the tooth root, meanwhile, experiences alternating bending stress. It will experience impact during engagement. Poor installation can lead to improper tooth surface contact. 2. Failure Modes Gear failure modes include tooth fracture and surface damage failures, such as pitting, wear, and plastic deformation. 1) Tooth fracture Classified by failure mechanisms, we have: fatigue fracture—occurs when a cantilever beam is subjected to fluctuating bending stresses or stress concentrations, causing fatigue cracks to propagate from the tensile side at the tooth root until final fracture; overload fracture—resulting from excessively high impact loads or short-term, severe overloading; and wear-induced fracture, where severe tooth wear reduces the gear's static strength, ultimately leading to failure. There are two forms of fracture in terms of morphology: complete fracture and partial fracture. From a design perspective, the gear teeth should undergo calculations to assess their root bending strength. From a manufacturing standpoint, increasing the radius of the fillet at the tooth root, reducing surface roughness, applying surface hardening treatments, and minimizing machining-induced damage on the tooth flank can all help enhance the tooth's resistance to fatigue failure. Additionally, improving the stiffness of the shaft and supports—and ideally eliminating any uneven distribution of loads—can significantly reduce the likelihood of localized tooth fractures. 2) Pitting corrosion
When gears are in operation, prolonged exposure to pulsating cyclic stresses can cause tiny metal flakes to detach, resulting in the formation of shallow pits. Phenomenon: Pitting typically occurs in well-lubricated, closed gear drives. The specific locations are usually near the pitch line, where relative sliding velocities are low, making it difficult to form a lubricant film. In spur gear drives, contact stresses are also relatively high, further increasing the likelihood of pitting. To reduce pitting, the following measures can be taken: From a design perspective, the gear should undergo calculations to ensure adequate tooth surface contact strength. From a manufacturing perspective, In terms of engineering, the tooth surface hardness should be increased, and its roughness reduced; appropriate modification should be employed; lubricants with higher viscosity should be used; and dynamic loads should be minimized."

3. Gear Inspection After gears have operated for a period of time, tooth profile errors increase due to wear on the tooth surfaces, which ultimately affects their performance. Therefore, it is essential that the gear teeth remain intact, with no signs of extrusion deformation, cracks, or broken teeth. Additionally, wear on the tooth thickness should be kept within limits—not exceeding 0.15 times the module. In production, specialized gear thickness calipers are commonly used to check for deviations in tooth thickness, effectively controlling backlash by measuring the reduction in tooth thickness. Alternatively, a universal involute micrometer can be employed to assess variations in the length of the gear’s normal chord, ensuring precise gear motion accuracy. This method is simple and practical, making it widely adopted in manufacturing processes. Furthermore, the gear’s internal bore, keyways, splines, and threads must all meet standard specifications, with no instances of scoring or damage allowed. 2.5.3 Gear Maintenance and Repair The methods for gear repair are primarily determined based on the gear's failure mode, production technology conditions, and application requirements. For small to medium module gears, if spare parts are readily available, repairs are typically avoided in favor of replacing the gear entirely with a new one. However, when replacing gears, it’s generally recommended to swap them in pairs to ensure optimal meshing performance. If spare parts aren’t sufficient, large gears can be repaired using precision finishing techniques, while smaller gears are replaced altogether. For worn-out large-module gears, dimensional restoration can be achieved through spraying, followed by fine finishing of the tooth surfaces. In cases where large-module gears suffer from broken teeth or cracks, repair methods such as tooth insertion or weld patching are employed."

1.3.2 Corrosion of Metal Parts In the field of engineering, metal corrosion leads to enormous economic losses—estimates suggest that globally, steel and equipment scrapped annually due to corrosion account for approximately 30% of the world’s annual steel production. Corrosion is the process by which metals are damaged as a result of interactions with their surrounding environment, typically occurring when metal components undergo chemical or electrochemical reactions under specific environmental conditions. Corrosive damage always begins at the metal’s surface, gradually progressing inward—sometimes rapidly, sometimes more slowly—leading to material loss, degradation of surface quality, and even internal crystal structure damage. This ultimately results in irregularly shaped defects such as pits and spots, severely compromising the component’s integrity and eventually causing it to fail. Metal corrosion is broadly classified into two main categories based on its mechanism and underlying processes: chemical corrosion and electrochemical corrosion. Chemical Corrosion of Metal Parts Chemical corrosion of metals is caused by purely chemical reactions. When the surface material of a metal part interacts chemically with harmful components present in surrounding gases or non-electrolytic liquids, a corrosion layer forms on the metal surface. As this layer continuously flakes off and regenerates, the part gradually deteriorates. The primary harmful substances that react chemically with mechanical components include gases like O₂, H₂S, and SO₂, as well as certain corrosive byproducts found in lubricating oils. Among these, the chemical reaction between iron and oxygen is the most common form of chemical corrosion. Erosion, the process is as follows.
4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃ 3Fe + 2O₂ → Fe₃O₄ Corrosion products such as Fe₂O₃ or Fe₃O₄ typically form a protective film that coats the metal surface. During friction, Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment 21 After the surface oxide film is worn away, the friction surface quickly reacts with the oxidizing medium, forming a new oxide layer that is subsequently removed during the friction  process. This cyclical process ultimately leads to metal corrosion. A key characteristic of oxidative wear is the presence of uniform, fine grooves aligned along the sliding direc tion on the friction surface, accompanied by reddish-brown flaky Fe₂O₃ or grayish-black filamentous Fe₃O₄ debris. Debris is generated. The primary factors influencing oxidative wea r are the density and integrity of the oxide film, as well as how firmly it adheres to the substrate. If the oxide film is dense, intact, free of pores, and strongly bonded to the  metal substrate, it exhibits excellent wear resistance, resists being worn away easily, and effectively helps prevent corrosion of the metal surface. 2. Electrochemical Corrosion o f Metal Parts Electrochemical corrosion is a complex physical and chemical process of corrosion. It can be defined as the continuous, charge-driven chemical corrosion that occurs w hen two metal electrodes with a potential difference are immersed in an electrolyte solution. This type of corrosion happens when metals come into contact with electrolytic substan ces, and its key distinction from ordinary chemical corrosion lies in the fact that it involves the flow of electric current during the process. The fundamental conditions necessar y for electrochemical corrosion to occur are: ① the presence of two or more objects with differing electrode potentials—or, within a single object, regions exhibiting different ele ctrode potentials—that act as positive and negative electrodes; ② a conductive pathway connecting the electrodes, either through a conductor or direct contact, allowing charges in  the corrosion zone to flow freely; and ③ the simultaneous presence of an electrolyte solution. Common forms of electrochemical corrosion include the following: (1) Uniform corrosio n. When a metal part or component exhibits a uniform corrosion pattern across its surface, it is referred to as uniform corrosion. This type of corrosion can occur in liquids, the  atmosphere, or soil. Among mechanical equipment, the most common form of uniform corrosion is atmospheric corrosion. In industrial areas, the atmosphere often contains higher conce ntrations of corrosive gases such as CO₂, SO₂, H₂S, NO₂, and Cl₂. Additionally, airborne dust particles may carry acidic, alkaline, or saline micro-particles, which, when adhering  to the surface of components, can absorb moisture from the air and form an electrolyte, ultimately leading to corrosion on the part's surface. (2) Pitting corrosion. On most surfac es of metal components, corrosion either doesn’t occur at all or is very mild; however, localized areas develop small corrosion pits that penetrate deeply into the material. This t ype of corrosion is known as pitting corrosion. Because metals used in industry often contain extremely tiny microelectrodes, they are highly susceptible to pitting corrosion when  exposed to aqueous solutions or humid environments. In the case of steel components, when pitting corrosion occurs alongside uniform corrosion, the corrosion spots can easily becom e obscured by the porous structure formed during uniform corrosion, making them difficult to detect and identify. As a result, pitting corrosion is one of the most dangerous forms  of corrosion. (3) Crevice corrosion. In机电 equipment, gaps exist between various connected components—typically ranging from 0.025 to 0.1 mm. When corrosive media enter these gaps a nd remain trapped, localized corrosion can occur precisely at the crevices. For instance, this type of crevice corrosion often happens at flange faces where pipes are connected, as  well as at the riveted joints of metal rivets. (4) Corrosion Fatigue. When metallic components subjected to cyclic stress experience reduced fatigue strength or shortened fatigue  life—and ultimately fail—due to the presence of a corrosive environment, this phenomenon is known as corrosion fatigue or corrosion fatigue fracture. Corrosion fatigue can cause me tal components to fracture even under very low levels of cyclic (pulsating) stress, and often there is no clear fatigue limit. As a result, damage caused by corrosion fatigue tends  to be more severe than that resulting from pure mechanical fatigue alone. To prevent and reduce corrosion failures, as well as minimize their harmful effects on equipment, special  attention must be paid during the manufacturing process to correctly selecting materials for components and thoughtfully designing various structural elements. Additionally, for p arts operating in corrosive environments, advanced anti-corrosion measures such as surface coating technologies, electrochemical protection techniques, and the addition of corrosio n inhibitors should be employed to ensure that these components remain protected—or at least minimally affected—by corrosive agents.

2.5.1 Characteristics and Applications of Gear Transmission Gear transmission is one of the most commonly used methods of power transmission, relying on the meshing of gear teeth to transfer motion and power. It is characterized by its ability to ensure an accurate transmission ratio, handle a wide range of power and speed levels, achieve high transmission efficiency, maintain a compact design, and offer long service life—though gear transmissions do require relatively high precision in manufacturing and assembly. There are several types of gear transmissions, which can be classified in different ways into straight teeth, helical teeth, and herringbone gear drives. They can also be categorized into cylindrical gears, bevel gears, and rack-and-pinion gear systems, among others. 2.5.2 Failure Modes of Gear Drives and Preventive Measures"

Context:  
When gears are in operation, prolonged exposure to pulsating cyclic stresses can cause tiny metal flakes to detach, resulting in the formation of shallow pits. Phenomenon: Pitting typically occurs in well-lubricated, closed gear drives. The specific locations are usually near the pitch line, where relative sliding velocities are low, making it difficult to form a lubricant film. In spur gear drives, contact stresses are also relatively high, further increasing the likelihood of pitting. To reduce pitting, the following measures can be taken: From a design perspective, the gear should undergo calculations to ensure adequate tooth surface contact strength. From a manufacturing perspective, In terms of engineering, the tooth surface hardness should be increased, and its roughness reduced; appropriate modification should be employed; lubricants with higher viscosity should be used; and dynamic loads should be minimized.
4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃ 3Fe + 2O₂ → Fe₃O₄ Corrosion products such as Fe₂O₃ or Fe₃O₄ typically form a protective film that coats the metal surface. During friction, Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment 21 After the surface oxide film is worn away, the friction surface quickly reacts with the oxidizing medium, forming a new oxide layer that is subsequently removed during the friction  process. This cyclical process ultimately leads to metal corrosion. A key characteristic of oxidative wear is the presence of uniform, fine grooves aligned along the sliding direc tion on the friction surface, accompanied by reddish-brown flaky Fe₂O₃ or grayish-black filamentous Fe₃O₄ debris. Debris is generated. The primary factors influencing oxidative wea r are the density and integrity of the oxide film, as well as how firmly it adheres to the substrate. If the oxide film is dense, intact, free of pores, and strongly bonded to the  metal substrate, it exhibits excellent wear resistance, resists being worn away easily, and effectively helps prevent corrosion of the metal surface. 2. Electrochemical Corrosion o f Metal Parts Electrochemical corrosion is a complex physical and chemical process of corrosion. It can be defined as the continuous, charge-driven chemical corrosion that occurs w hen two metal electrodes with a potential difference are immersed in an electrolyte solution. This type of corrosion happens when metals come into contact with electrolytic substan ces, and its key distinction from ordinary chemical corrosion lies in the fact that it involves the flow of electric current during the process. The fundamental conditions necessar y for electrochemical corrosion to occur are: ① the presence of two or more objects with differing electrode potentials—or, within a single object, regions exhibiting different ele ctrode potentials—that act as positive and negative electrodes; ② a conductive pathway connecting the electrodes, either through a conductor or direct contact, allowing charges in  the corrosion zone to flow freely; and ③ the simultaneous presence of an electrolyte solution. Common forms of electrochemical corrosion include the following: (1) Uniform corrosio n. When a metal part or component exhibits a uniform corrosion pattern across its surface, it is referred to as uniform corrosion. This type of corrosion can occur in liquids, the  atmosphere, or soil. Among mechanical equipment, the most common form of uniform corrosion is atmospheric corrosion. In industrial areas, the atmosphere often contains higher conce ntrations of corrosive gases such as CO₂, SO₂, H₂S, NO₂, and Cl₂. Additionally, airborne dust particles may carry acidic, alkaline, or saline micro-particles, which, when adhering  to the surface of components, can absorb moisture from the air and form an electrolyte, ultimately leading to corrosion on the part's surface. (2) Pitting corrosion. On most surfac es of metal components, corrosion either doesn’t occur at all or is very mild; however, localized areas develop small corrosion pits that penetrate deeply into the material. This t ype of corrosion is known as pitting corrosion. Because metals used in industry often contain extremely tiny microelectrodes, they are highly susceptible to pitting corrosion when  exposed to aqueous solutions or humid environments. In the case of steel components, when pitting corrosion occurs alongside uniform corrosion, the corrosion spots can easily becom e obscured by the porous structure formed during uniform corrosion, making them difficult to detect and identify. As a result, pitting corrosion is one of the most dangerous forms  of corrosion. (3) Crevice corrosion. In机电 equipment, gaps exist between various connected components—typically ranging from 0.025 to 0.1 mm. When corrosive media enter these gaps a nd remain trapped, localized corrosion can occur precisely at the crevices. For instance, this type of crevice corrosion often happens at flange faces where pipes are connected, as  well as at the riveted joints of metal rivets. (4) Corrosion Fatigue. When metallic components subjected to cyclic stress experience reduced fatigue strength or shortened fatigue  life—and ultimately fail—due to the presence of a corrosive environment, this phenomenon is known as corrosion fatigue or corrosion fatigue fracture. Corrosion fatigue can cause me tal components to fracture even under very low levels of cyclic (pulsating) stress, and often there is no clear fatigue limit. As a result, damage caused by corrosion fatigue tends  to be more severe than that resulting from pure mechanical fatigue alone. To prevent and reduce corrosion failures, as well as minimize their harmful effects on equipment, special  attention must be paid during the manufacturing process to correctly selecting materials for components and thoughtfully designing various structural elements. Additionally, for p arts operating in corrosive environments, advanced anti-corrosion measures such as surface coating technologies, electrochemical protection techniques, and the addition of corrosio n inhibitors should be employed to ensure that these components remain protected—or at least minimally affected—by corrosive agents.

Working Conditions Power is transmitted through tooth surface contact, with the two tooth surfaces meshing together in a motion that involves both rolling and sliding. The gear surface is subjected to alternating contact compressive stress and friction forces; the tooth root, meanwhile, experiences alternating bending stress. Now, let’s move on to Chapter 2: Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Commonly Used Mechanical Components. 67 It will experience impact during engagement. Poor installation can lead to improper tooth surface contact. 2. Failure Modes Gear failure modes include tooth fracture and surface damage failures, such as pitting, wear, and plastic deformation. 1) Tooth fracture Classified by failure mechanisms, we have: fatigue fracture—occurs when a cantilever beam is subjected to fluctuating bending stresses or stress concentrations, causing fatigue cracks to propagate from the tensile side at the tooth root until final fracture; overload fracture—resulting from excessively high impact loads or short-term, severe overloading; and wear-induced fracture, where severe tooth wear reduces the gear's static strength, ultimately leading to failure. There are two forms of fracture in terms of morphology: complete fracture and partial fracture. From a design perspective, the gear teeth should undergo calculations to assess their root bending strength. From a manufacturing standpoint, increasing the radius of the fillet at the tooth root, reducing surface roughness, applying surface hardening treatments, and minimizing machining-induced damage on the tooth flank can all help enhance the tooth's resistance to fatigue failure. Additionally, improving the stiffness of the shaft and supports—and ideally eliminating any uneven distribution of loads—can significantly reduce the likelihood of localized tooth fractures. 2) Pitting corrosion"
