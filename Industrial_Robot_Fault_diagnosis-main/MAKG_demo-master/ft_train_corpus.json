In hydraulic systems, the hydraulic pump is the primary source of vibration, accounting for approximately 75% of the total system\u2019s vibrational noise. Therefore, reducing the vibration of the hydraulic pump is a critical measure for improving product performance. Hydraulic pump flow pulsation is an intrinsic characteristic of the pump\u2014particularly in axial piston pumps, where multiple pistons operate simultaneously, creating distinct oil-discharge and oil-suction chambers. As a result, the pump\u2019s instantaneous flow rate at any given moment equals the sum of the instantaneous flows from all pistons currently in the discharge chamber. In other words, the output flow of an axial piston pump is essentially the superposition of individual sinusoidal flow patterns generated by each piston.

The throttle valve features a needle-type orifice: when air flows in through port A, it lifts the one-way valve open, allowing airflow to exit from port O; however, when air enters through port P, the one-way valve closes, forcing the airflow to pass through the throttling orifice before exiting from port P.\n2.

As a result, the pressure drop across the valve diminishes, allowing the outlet pressure to recover.\nIn this process, if friction forces, the weight of the spool, and steady-state hydrodynamic forces are neglected, the spool is balanced solely by the downward hydrodynamic force (equal to the outlet pressure) acting on its lower surface and the upward spring force (approximately equal to the setpoint pressure). This balance ensures that the outlet pressure remains stable under normal operating conditions.\nOriginally, the set pressure remained unchanged.\nThe pressure relief valve is primarily used to reduce and stabilize the oil pressure in a specific branch of the system, commonly employed in troubleshooting and maintenance case studies for electromechanical systems such as clamping, control, and lubrication applications.\n116\nIn the oil circuit.\nCharacteristics of the pressure relief valve: The valve is connected in series with the load, and the adjustment spring chamber features an external oil drain.",
