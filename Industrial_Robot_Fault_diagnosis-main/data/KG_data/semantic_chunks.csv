0,"1.1.1 Meaning of the Failure Typically, a failure is defined as a condition in which a device (system) or component has lost its specified functionality. From a systems perspective, failure carries two key meanings: first, it refers to the mechanical system deviating from its normal function. The primary cause of this deviation lies in Chapter 1—Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Electromechanical Equipment. 3 Work conditions (including components) are abnormal, and these types of failures can be resolved by adjusting parameters or repairing the affected parts, allowing the system to return to normal operation. The second scenario is functional failure, where the system continuously deviates from its intended performance, with the degree of deviation steadily worsening—eventually rendering the equipment unable to perform its basic functions. Such situations are classified as failures. Typically, failed individual components can be replaced; however, if critical components fail, it often results in the complete loss of the machine’s functionality. The primary goal of failure analysis is to identify failure modes, uncover underlying failure mechanisms, and develop strategies to minimize failures, ultimately enhancing the reliability and effective utilization of electromechanical equipment. For the fault, the following points should be clarified:",text-EN.txt
1,"(1) The defined object. This refers to a single machine, a system composed of several individual machines, or a specific component on the equipment. Different objects may experience varying failure conditions at the same time. For instance, on an automated production line, the failure of a single machine can be enough to disable the entire system; however, in a workshop with a clustered machine layout, the failure of one machine would not necessarily be linked to a breakdown affecting the entire workshop. (2) Time-to-failure. This refers to the fact that the probability of a failure increases as time goes on. In addition to using direct units like years, months, days, or hours, time can also be measured by the number of equipment operations, mileage, or cycles. For instance, vehicles typically use total miles driven as their unit of measurement, while gears might be measured by the number of load-bearing cycles they endure. (3) The specified conditions. These refer to the operational and maintenance conditions during equipment operation, the skill level of personnel, environmental factors, and more. Different conditions will lead to different types of failures. (4) The specified function. It depends on the particular issue at hand. For example, in a lathe operating in the same state, damage to the feed screw would be considered a malfunction when it comes to threading operations—but not when machining end faces, since the two scenarios require different functional capabilities from the lathe. (5) A certain degree of failure. This refers to assessing the severity of functional loss from a quantitative perspective. In production practice, to encompass all possible events, a broad definition of failure has been established: ""A failure is an unqualified state."" 1.1.2 Classification of Failures Mechanical and electrical equipment failures can be categorized from various perspectives, with each classification method highlighting a different aspect of the fault. The purpose of categorizing failures is to assess the severity of the incident, analyze its root causes, and ultimately enable more effective, tailored responses to address the specific types of malfunctions. By examining factors such as failure nature, underlying causes, and distinctive characteristics, faults can be grouped into the following categories. By fault nature (1) Intermittent failures. The equipment temporarily loses certain functions, with the faults often caused by external factors affecting the mechanical and electrical systems—such as operator error, climate changes, or inadequate environmental conditions. Once the external interference is removed or the equipment undergoes minor repairs and adjustments, its functionality typically resumes. (2) Permanent failure. Once this type of failure occurs, it can only be restored through manual repair; otherwise, the fault will persist indefinitely. Such failures are typically caused by damage to specific components. 2) By Severity of the Fault (1) Localized failure. A specific part of the机电 equipment is malfunctioning, causing that particular component to lose its functionality while other parts continue to operate as intended—essentially, a partial functional breakdown. (2) Systemic Failure. A failure that results in the complete loss of system functionality—though it may initially appear as a malfunction in a specific component, it ultimately prevents the device from performing its intended function altogether.

2,"3) By the rate at which the fault develops (1) Sudden failures. These failures occur unexpectedly and spontaneously, typically independent of the equipment’s usage time. They are often preceded by no obvious warning signs, making them difficult to predict even through early-stage testing or trials. Such failures usually result from a combination of inherent adverse factors within the process system and unpredictable external influences. (2) Gradual failure. These failures develop slowly and typically occur during the later stages of an electromechanical device's useful life. Their likelihood of occurrence is closely tied to the equipment's usage time, and they can often be predicted through early-stage testing or monitoring. Such failures usually result from the gradual progression of issues like corrosion, wear, fatigue, and material aging in the components. 4) By the cause of fault formation (1) Failures caused by operational or management errors, such as using机电 equipment under conditions that deviate from the original design specifications, leading to improper equipment usage. (2) Failures caused by inherent system factors. These typically arise from defects left over from system design or manufacturing—such as residual stresses or localized weak points—or from latent flaws within the materials themselves. Such failures are unpredictable and represent a major cause of sudden, unexpected breakdowns. (3) Natural failures. During the operational and maintenance period, mechanical and electrical equipment may experience failures caused by various external or internal natural factors—such as wear, fracture, corrosion, deformation, creep, aging, and other forms of damage that occur under normal conditions. 5) By the consequences caused by the failure (1) Critical Failure: A failure that endangers personal safety, results in injury or death, causes the scrapping of机电 equipment, or leads to significant financial losses. Examples include frame or body separation, wheel detachment, and complete engine assembly failure. (2) Minor faults. These are issues that affect the normal operation of mechanical and electrical equipment but can be resolved within a relatively short time. Examples include broken drive belts, damaged control handles, cracks or loose welds in sheet metal components, faulty electrical switches, minor leaks, and loose general fasteners. 6) By the period when the fault occurred (1) Early-stage failures. These faults may arise from design, manufacturing, or material defects and typically become apparent shortly after the equipment is first put into operation. Alternatively, certain components—such as gear pairs in gearboxes or other friction-based assemblies—often require an initial ""running-in"" period before their performance gradually improves. Once these early-stage issues are identified, addressed, and optimized, the failure rate tends to decline over time. (2) Failure during the useful life. This refers to failures that occur within a product's effective lifespan, caused by unpredictable, random factors related to both external loads (such as operational conditions) and intrinsic system characteristics (including internal factors like component failures or structural damage). Since equipment typically operates in this condition for most of its lifetime, the failure rate during this period remains relatively constant. Therefore, monitoring and diagnosing failures during this phase is critically important. (3) Late-stage failures (dissipation-phase failures). These typically occur during the latter part of a device's lifespan, often after the equipment has been in use for an extended period—or even beyond its intended service life. Such failures arise due to gradual wear, fatigue, and aging of the equipment's components, leading to a decline in system functionality. Ultimately, this can result in sudden, hazardous, and potentially widespread system breakdowns. During this phase, the failure rate of the equipment tends to increase steadily. To prevent accidents, it’s crucial to monitor and diagnose the system regularly, promptly replacing any identified failing components before they cause a major incident. As illustrated by the classification of these failures, mechanical and electrical equipment malfunctions are often interconnected and can evolve over time—shifting from one type of failure to another. Ultimately, every type of machinery and equipment failure will manifest as a specific issue, underscoring the importance of comprehensive diagnostic and maintenance strategies. 5",text-EN.txt
3,"The material condition and characteristics. 1.1.3 Characteristics of the Failure Diversity Various pieces of equipment not only differ in structure and process parameters, but also vary in their manufacturing, installation processes, and operating environments—leading to a wide range of potential failures during operation. Hierarchical Structure Once a device exhibits a certain failure symptom, it becomes necessary to investigate the root cause of the malfunction. However, some failure causes are often deeply rooted—meaning that a higher-level failure stems from a lower-level one, creating a hierarchical pattern. Multifactorial and Correlation The components of the equipment—and even individual devices—are interconnected through mechanical structures or material transfer. If one component or device fails, it can trigger malfunctions in other components or devices as well, highlighting the multifactorial and interconnected nature of failures. Therefore, when diagnosing the root cause of a malfunction, it’s essential to thoroughly consider all relevant factors involved. Delayed Response During operation, equipment components are continuously subjected to factors such as impact, stress, friction, wear, and corrosion, leading to vibrations, displacements, deformations, fatigue, and crack propagation. These processes gradually degrade the equipment's condition—until, at a certain point, the degradation becomes severe enough to result in mechanical malfunctions or even complete loss of functionality. The time-lag inherent in this failure progression underscores the importance of identifying potential issues early on and implementing preventive measures promptly, thereby minimizing the damage that could arise when a failure ultimately occurs. Uncertainty (Ambiguity) A single fault phenomenon can arise from multiple underlying causes; conversely, a single cause may manifest in various fault symptoms. The occurrence of faults, their specific manifestations, quantitative descriptions, and detection analyses all involve inherent uncertainties, thereby complicating the tasks of fault diagnosis and repair. Restorative",text-EN.txt
4,Most failures are repairable.,text-EN.txt
5,"1.1.4 Management of Failures Equipment failure management is a critical component of overall equipment maintenance. Effectively leveraging the fault information generated during equipment operation—by analyzing data from multiple perspectives and predicting potential failures—and subsequently implementing proactive measures to minimize equipment-related losses are essential for enhancing overall equipment management practices. Establishing a procedure for managing enterprise equipment failures is the first step in building an accident early-warning mechanism, and correctly developing such a procedure is of great significance. To effectively manage equipment failures, it’s essential to thoroughly understand the root causes of breakdowns, systematically collect data and information on common and typical failures, conduct in-depth failure analyses, emphasize research into failure patterns and mechanisms, and strengthen routine maintenance, inspections, and preventive repairs. The purpose of equipment failure management is to monitor and diagnose equipment conditions before failures occur, enabling operators to identify any signs of degradation. This proactive approach aims to detect early warning indicators and potential risks, allowing for timely preventive maintenance to effectively control the occurrence of failures. After a failure does happen, the process involves promptly analyzing the root cause, developing targeted solutions, and implementing measures to either resolve the issue or improve the equipment—ultimately preventing future occurrences. Case Study Tutorial on Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechatronic Systems",text-EN.txt
6,"6 The procedure for equipment failure management is outlined below. (1) Conduct thorough education and awareness campaigns to ensure that operators and maintenance personnel voluntarily comply with relevant rules and regulations regarding operation, maintenance, inspection, etc., properly use and carefully maintain equipment, and diligently record, compile statistics, and analyze any equipment malfunctions. (2) Based on the company’s actual production conditions, equipment status, and specific features, determine the key areas for equipment failure management. (3) Use monitoring instruments and diagnostic techniques to systematically monitor critical equipment, enabling timely detection of fault indicators and deterioration. Information on equipment condition. Typically, equipment can undergo daily inspections, routine patrols, and periodic checks (including precision assessments), as well as integrity assessments—using human senses and common diagnostic tools—to closely monitor the technical status and any unusual signs in components, mechanisms, and areas prone to failure. At the same time, inspection standards should be established to clearly define the boundaries between normal operation, abnormalities, and equipment failures. (4) To quickly locate the fault location and its cause, in addition to providing training to ensure that maintenance and operational staff acquire a solid understanding of electrical and hydraulic technologies, it is also essential to compile common equipment failure symptoms, analysis procedures, and troubleshooting methods into a fault-finding logic flowchart. This will enable operators to swiftly identify the source and root cause of any malfunction after it occurs, allowing for timely diagnosis, repair, and restoration of equipment functionality. (5) Improve the fault recording system. Fault records serve as the foundational data for effective fault management and also provide the original basis for conducting fault analysis and troubleshooting. Records must be complete and accurate. After on-site inspections and fault repairs, maintenance personnel should follow the ""Equipment Carefully complete the  ""Equipment Failure Repair Form "" and submit monthly statistical analyses to the equipment management department. (6) Conduct timely statistics and analysis of equipment failures. In addition to monitoring failur e situations on a daily basis, staff members should compile  ""Failure Repair Forms "" and maintenance records on a monthly basis. By systematically collecting, organizing, and analyzing failure data, it’s possible to calculate the failure frequency and mean time b etween failures for each type of equipment. Furthermore, this process allows for an in-depth analysis of individual equipment failure trends and identifies key root causes, helping  to pinpoint recurring patterns. Armed with this insight, teams can prioritize their response strategies effectively. Finally, the compiled and analyzed failure information should  be shared back with the planning department, enabling them to schedule preventive maintenance or implement improvement measures. This data can also serve as a valuable reference fo r adjusting the intervals, content, and standards of routine inspections. (7) Implement different countermeasures based on the nature of the failure, the type of fault, and the spe cific characteristics of the equipment. For newly acquired equipment, strengthen management during the initial phase of use—carefully monitor and document the equipment’s precision , performance, and any emerging defects from the outset. During operation, emphasize routine maintenance, regular patrol inspections, and periodic checks to promptly identify early  warning signs and take appropriate adjustment or troubleshooting actions. For critical equipment, conduct condition monitoring and diagnostics. Establish a flexible and responsive  maintenance team equipped with advanced technical expertise, employing rapid repair techniques such as component-by-component fixes or group-based replacements. Ensure timely avai lability of high-quality spare parts, leverage production downtime for equipment overhauls, and apply measures like retrofitting or replacing components when wear patterns have bee n thoroughly understood. (8) Carry out routine maintenance tasks effectively to control equipment failures. Utilize status information and early warning signs of potential issues g athered during daily rounds by regional maintenance workers, as well as scheduled equipment condition checks, along with relevant records and analysis data. Based on the specific c haracteristics of each type of equipment and the general defects already identified, the workshop’s equipment mechanic (technician) or maintenance team leader should promptly sched ule routine repairs—ideally during production downtime or weekend slots—to proactively address problems before they escalate, thereby minimizing breakdowns. For certain failure ind icators or hidden risks that exceed the scope of routine maintenance, these should be reported back to the planning department for scheduling dedicated, planned maintenance activit ies instead. (9) Establish a rational fault information management flowchart.",text-EN.txt
7,"1.1.5 Key Factors Influencing Failure Generation The more complex the mechanical and electrical equipment, the more diverse the potential causes of failure. The main factors influencing these failures include the following aspects. 1) Design Planning In the design planning phase, accurate estimates of the equipment's future operating conditions are essential, and potential variations should be thoroughly considered. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance 7 Consideration: Imperfect design solutions and inadequate review of design drawings and technical documents are major causes of failures. 2) Material Selection In design, manufacturing, and maintenance, it is essential to correctly select materials based on the nature and characteristics of the part’s function. Improper material selection, failure to meet specified material standards, or the use of inappropriate substitutes are major causes of phenomena such as wear, corrosion, excessive deformation, fatigue, cracking, and aging. Additionally, during manufacturing and repair processes, many materials undergo various fabrication steps, including casting, forging, welding, and heat treatment. Throughout these processes, the microstructure and mechanical/physical properties of the materials often undergo significant changes—among which the effects of heating and cooling are particularly critical. 3) Manufacturing Quality Errors exist in every step of the manufacturing process. The variability in process conditions and material properties inevitably leads to differences among parts during casting, Stress concentrations, local defects, and microscopic cracks—such as those arising during forging, welding, heat treatment, and machining—are common issues. These flaws are often overlooked during process inspections. As a result, the manufacturing quality of parts frequently fails to meet requirements, which is a major reason behind the short lifespan of mechanical equipment. 4) Assembly Quality First, there must be proper fit requirements. The tolerance limits for the clearance include the initial clearance that remains after assembly and running-in. If the initial clearance is too large, the effective service life will be shortened. Additionally, the positional accuracy between individual components during assembly is critical—failure to meet these specifications can lead to additional stresses, uneven wear, and ultimately accelerate component failure. 5) Proper Maintenance",text-EN.txt
8,"Following the principles of process rationality, cost-effectiveness, and production feasibility, carry out repairs in a sensible manner to ensure high-quality outcomes. Most importantly and critically, it’s essential to carefully select and apply the appropriate repair techniques, paying close attention to preparatory steps before restoration and adhering strictly to established procedures throughout the repair process. Operation procedures, as well as post-repair handling tasks.",text-EN.txt
9,"6) Use correctly Under normal operating conditions, mechanical equipment follows its own failure patterns; however, when operating conditions change, these failure patterns also shift accordingly. The primary operating conditions include the following: (1) Load. The primary causes of wear and fatigue failure in mechanical equipment are the wear of components and their fatigue-induced damage. Under specified operating conditions, the rate of component wear over a given period is directly proportional to the magnitude of the load applied. Meanwhile, fatigue damage to components occurs only under certain types of cyclic loading and intensifies as the load increases. Thus, both wear and fatigue are functions of the applied load. Exceeding the design-rated load levels can lead to severe failure, which is unacceptable. (2) Environment. The environment includes the effects of climate, corrosive media, and other harmful substances, as well as the condition of the working object itself. Increased temperatures accelerate wear and corrosion, while excessively high humidity and corrosive agents present in the air can lead to both corrosion and corrosive wear. Additionally, excessive dust levels in the air and harsh operating conditions often contribute to equipment failures. However, the environment is an objective factor, and in certain situations, measures can be taken manually to improve it. (3) Maintenance and Operation. Establishing a sound maintenance system and strictly adhering to technical maintenance guidelines and operational procedures are crucial for ensuring the reliable performance of mechanical equipment and extending its service life. Additionally, it is essential to provide training for personnel to enhance their skills and expertise.",text-EN.txt

12,"1.2 Basics of Equipment Maintenance 1.2.1 Maintenance Method The method of equipment maintenance carries the meaning of a maintenance strategy. Modern equipment management emphasizes applying different maintenance approaches to various types of equipment, underscoring that equipment repair should align with the objective principles governing the physical lifecycle of machinery and materials. This approach ensures production continuity while optimizing the efficient use of maintenance resources, ultimately achieving the most cost-effective outcome over the equipment's entire lifespan. Commonly used maintenance methods for electromechanical equipment include the following: Reactive Maintenance Post-failure maintenance, also known as breakdown maintenance, damage repair, or unplanned maintenance, refers to repairs carried out after mechanical and electrical equipment has malfunctioned—essentially, ""if it breaks, we fix it."" For certain critical equipment, post-failure maintenance should be minimized whenever possible; however, for devices that have minimal impact on production or are backed up by redundant units, opting for post-failure maintenance is often the most cost-effective approach. Preventive Maintenance Maintenance performed before mechanical and electrical equipment fails is called preventive maintenance. Its main benefits include reducing unexpected equipment failures, ensuring continuous production, integrating equipment upkeep and repair tasks into a structured plan—thereby minimizing unplanned disruptions in production—and ultimately improving equipment utilization, lowering maintenance costs, and extending the equipment's natural lifespan. Preventive maintenance is categorized into two basic forms: Regular maintenance Regular maintenance is also known as planned maintenance or time-based preventive maintenance. It involves carrying out preventive maintenance activities at predetermined intervals and follows a cyclical pattern. This type of maintenance is based on the wear patterns of components, with specific guidelines for setting maintenance intervals, defining maintenance categories, outlining maintenance tasks, and estimating the associated workload. However, this approach to maintenance can lead to certain challenges: First, when equipment is still in good technical condition and fully capable of continuing operation, it may undergo major over-maintenance simply because the scheduled interval has arrived—resulting in unnecessary repairs. Second, if a machine’s technical condition has already deteriorated to the point where it can no longer meet production requirements, but the prescribed maintenance interval hasn’t yet been reached, no repair plan will be implemented, leading to under-maintenance. This method is particularly well-suited for process-oriented production equipment or power systems where the wear patterns are well understood, and operations are stable and contin uous—such as large-scale assembly line equipment or key machinery operating on automated production lines. Currently, China primarily implements two main types of equipment mainten ance systems: the Planned Preventive Maintenance System and the Planned Warranty System. (1) Planned Preventive Maintenance System (referred to as Planned Pre-Maintenance). This sy stem involves maintaining, inspecting, and repairing equipment according to its wear patterns, adhering to predetermined maintenance cycles and procedures, to ensure that the equip ment consistently remains in optimal technical condition. Its key features are outlined below. ① Perform daily cleaning, inspection, lubrication, tightening, and adjustments on equ ipment as required to minimize wear and ensure proper operation. ② Conduct regular inspections and adjustments of the equipment's operational status and wear levels according to th e prescribed schedule, ensuring that potential issues are promptly addressed. This allows you to monitor changes in the equipment's technical condition and adequately prepare the n ecessary resources for scheduled maintenance. ③ Conduct preventive maintenance on equipment in a planned and prepared manner. (2) The Planned Maintenance System (also known as the  Maintenance and Repair System) is a equipment maintenance approach that combines routine upkeep with scheduled inspections and repairs. Its key features are outlined below. ① Based  on the equipment's characteristics and condition, different maintenance categories and intervals are specified according to operational hours (such as production output and mileag e).",text-EN.txt
13,"② Based on maintenance practices, establish different repair categories and intervals for the equipment.

14,"2) Condition Monitoring and Maintenance This is a preventive maintenance approach based on the equipment's tec hnical condition, carried out precisely when needed. It relies on condition monitoring and advanced diagnostic techniques to track the gradual deterioration of equipment over time.  By leveraging highly predictive insights, this method allows for timely scheduling of preventive maintenance activities, which is why it’s also referred to as  ""predictive maintenance. "" At its core, this maintenance strategy integrates comprehensive data from various sources—such as inspections, routine upkeep, operational use, and repair activities—especially insights gained from diagnostics and monitoring. Through rigorous statistical analysis, it accurately assesses the extent of equipment degradation, identifies specific areas where failures may occur (or are likely to occur), and predicts trends in the equipment’s overall technical condition. Armed with this information, operators can then determine the most appropriate type of maintenance intervention. By doing so, organizations gain full control over maintenance activities, ensuring thorough preparation before repairs begin. Moreover, this approach enables seamless coordination with production schedules, maximizing equipment utilization while simultaneously extending the lifespan of critical components. However, this method does come with some drawbacks: it tends to be more expensive and requires sophisticated diagnostic capabilities. Additionally, it demands highly skilled technicians who can interpret complex data and make informed decisions. This approach is particularly well-suited for critical, high-value equipment, key assets on production lines, machinery that cannot be easily disassembled for inspection (such as precision machine tools), and systems whose failure could lead to significant environmental or public health concerns.",text-EN.txt
15,"3. Reliability Maintenance Also known as Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM), this approach emerged in the U.S. civil aviation industry during the 1960s and is now widely implemented in industries with particularly high demands for equipment operational reliability, such as the nuclear and military sectors. While the time it takes for a potential failure in operating equipment to evolve into a functional failure can vary, all failure patterns eventually reveal detectable trends through systematic monitoring. This technique leverages these predictable patterns to implement proactive maintenance measures—making it a reliability-focused maintenance strategy aimed at enhancing equipment dependability. Rooted in reliability theory, RCM involves detailed analysis and experimentation of factors influencing system reliability, followed by the application of logical decision-making processes. This approach enables the scientific development of tailored maintenance plans, the optimal selection of repair methods, and the precise determination of equipment lifespan—all designed to maintain and restore the inherent reliability of assets while minimizing costs. Reliability-based maintenance is advancing equipment repair work toward greater scientific rigor and modernization, making it worthy of further attention and research. 4. Quality Maintenance This is an equipment maintenance procedure developed with a focus on ensuring product quality, aiming to keep all critical quality characteristics of product components and parts in optimal condition. To achieve this goal, the method manages key factors influencing quality—such as people, machines, and materials—and places particular emphasis on the relationship between equipment performance and product quality. It employs tools from Total Quality Management, including graphical techniques like Pareto charts, as well as statistical analysis methods. By closely monitoring product quality conditions, the process identifies problematic production steps, pinpointing faulty equipment areas and their root causes, and then systematically categorizes and organizes this information. Based on the severity of each issue, critical problems are prioritized, analyzed one by one, and targeted recovery measures are formulated. For chronic quality issues where the root cause remains unclear, PM analysis (Process-Machine Phenomenon Analysis) is utilized to investigate further. Perform a root cause analysis to identify the reasons and solutions, and establish a management system to prevent future failures.",text-EN.txt
16,"5. Improve Maintenance Improvement maintenance, also known as corrective maintenance, refers to a type of repair that enhances the technical performance of mechanical and electrical equipment to prevent recurring failures. It involves integrating maintenance activities with technological upgrades, ensuring that after repairs, key aspects such as precision, performance, and efficiency of the equipment are improved. Rate. During operation, mechanical and electrical equipment often has certain weak links, which necessitates technical improvements and structural modifications to specific devices or components. These enhancements aim to boost reliability and elevate the overall technological level of the equipment, ultimately leading to better economic outcomes. A key feature of improvement-based maintenance is its integrated approach, frequently combined with major overhauls and targeted repairs in actual production settings. When implementing such improvement maintenance, it’s essential to systematically address and refine the mechanisms of the equipment, as well as enhance the diagnostic and repair capabilities of electromechanical systems—based on thorough inspection and analysis of component failures. 10",text-EN.txt
17,"Material details, etc. 6. Maintenance-Free Design Maintenance-free design is the ideal goal for equipment maintenance—it refers to implementing improvement measures during the design phase of new machinery and electrical equipment to address common failures encountered during maintenance, aiming to minimize maintenance efforts or even eliminate the need for repairs altogether. 1.2.2 Maintenance Method Selection The purpose of maintenance is to ensure the reliable operation of equipment—specifically, to guarantee the dependable fulfillment of its intended use—and, at the same time, minimize maintenance costs. Therefore, the fundamental requirements for maintenance decisions are: ① Reliability must not fall below the permissible minimum value [R], meaning that ()[] R ≥ R(t); ② Maintenance costs (KI) must be kept as low as possible—or, alternatively, must not exceed a predetermined maintenance cost limit (KImin), i.e., K ≤ KImin. To optimize maintenance decisions, the first step should be to choose an appropriate maintenance approach. The six maintenance methods mentioned above each have a specific scope of applicability; however, their effectiveness can vary depending on how appropriately they are applied. To maximize equipment efficiency, minimize downtime-related losses, and reduce maintenance costs, it’s essential to select the most suitable approach based on the characteristics of mechatronic systems and the conditions under which they are used. Looking ahead, the trend in maintenance practices is shifting from routine preventive maintenance toward planned, periodic inspections—and then, based on inspection findings, scheduling timely condition-based repairs. As the technological sophistication of factory equipment continues to rise, with increasingly complex system designs and broader adoption of mechatronic solutions, production activities are becoming more reliant on equipment performance and reliability. Consequently, the traditional static approach to maintenance management is evolving into a more dynamic model, gradually moving toward advanced strategies such as reliability-centered maintenance and quality-focused repair practices. Mechatronic equipment comes in a wide variety of types and is widely applied, making it essential to select one or a combination of maintenance methods tailored to the specific situation. When choosing a maintenance approach for mechatronic systems, reliability typically becomes the primary focus. For critical components, implementing condition-based monitoring allows for timely preventive measures. Meanwhile, for equipment at quality control points, it’s crucial to closely track changes in product quality during the manufacturing process and promptly address any detected anomalies through quality repairs. Additionally, it’s important to equip teams with personnel who are well-versed in microelectronics technology, providing them with supervision and guidance while fostering the development of skilled, integrated mechatronics technicians. Regular inspections and logical fault analysis should be conducted on CNC and other mechatronic systems, and any failed components identified must be promptly replaced and properly adjusted to ensure optimal performance. 1.2.3 Maintenance System Maintenance work is not only a technical task but also a managerial one. A maintenance system refers to a set of guidelines established under specific maintenance theories and principles, encompassing elements such as maintenance plans, categories, methods, timing, scope, levels, organizational structures, and performance evaluation metrics. Implementing a rational maintenance system helps optimize the allocation of human, material, and financial resources, enabling timely preparation before maintenance tasks, ensuring repairs are carried out appropriately, meeting operational requirements, enhancing the technical condition, reliability, and service life of机电 equipment, reducing downtime, and minimizing maintenance costs and production losses due to equipment shutdowns. Meanwhile, maintenance systems are continuously evolving and improving—currently, the main approaches include the following: Planned Preventive Maintenance System It is based on a thorough understanding of the wear and failure patterns of mechanical and electrical equipment, applying the principle of pre vention being better than cure—and addressing potential issues before they escalate—by systematically organizing maintenance and repairs according to the rate of wear and expected  service life of each component. This approach helps prevent premature wear, compensates for natural degradation, minimizes or avoids failures altogether, extends equipment lifespan , and ultimately saves time spent on repairs, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and boosting economic returns. The practical implementation of planned preventive maintenance  can be summarized as  ""regular inspections, timely upkeep, and scheduled repairs, "" making it particularly suitable for Chapter 1 of this guide: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment. 11 Macro-level management. I mplementing a planned preventive maintenance system requires the following conditions: ① Determining the maintenance intervals for assemblies and key components through statistical analysis, measurements, and experimental studies, and rationally categorizing mainten ance tasks;",text-EN.txt
18,② Establishing a set of corresponding technical standards for maintenance teams;,text-EN.txt
19,"③ Having well-equipped maintenance facilities organized according to functional divisions and strategically located for optimal efficiency. The main drawback of the planned preven tive maintenance system is its poor cost-effectiveness. With fixed maintenance cycles and scopes, it often leads to unnecessary repairs of certain components—what’s known as over-m aintenance. During the maintenance process, repairs are categorized into several levels and types based on the depth and breadth of the work required, including major overhauls, mi d-level repairs, minor repairs, item-specific repairs, retrofits, and unplanned maintenance tasks—all determined by the scale and nature of the repair workload. (1) Overhaul: A com prehensive or fundamental restoration of the functionality of mechanical and electrical equipment, typically carried out by specialized maintenance teams within factories and mines —or at repair centers established in regions with a high concentration of industrial facilities. During an overhaul, the equipment is either fully or extensively disassembled, with  a focus on repairing critical components, replacing or refurbishing parts that have lost their function or are on the verge of doing so. After the repairs, the equipment’s precisi on is restored to nearly its original factory specifications, while also receiving a fresh cosmetic overhaul to enhance its appearance. (2) Intermediate Overhaul. This is a level o f maintenance that falls between major and minor overhauls, serving as a balanced approach to upkeep. (3) Minor Repair. This involves replacing or repairing components that have si gnificantly worn out or are nearing failure within the maintenance interval, without addressing any underlying structural issues. It is a troubleshooting-based repair aimed at rest oring functionality. The three levels—major overhaul, mid-term repair, and minor repair—objectively reflect the chronological progression of机电 equipment, making them ideally suited  for implementing time-based planned preventive maintenance, a practice widely adopted by most organizations. However, these levels still require complementary repair tiers to addr ess unforeseen maintenance needs effectively. (4) Item-based maintenance. Based on condition monitoring of mechanical and electrical equipment, this involves proactively planning r epairs specifically for components or technical items that are about to fail. Item-based maintenance is conducted between major, medium, and minor overhauls—it’s a non-periodic, pl anned maintenance level that doesn’t follow a fixed cycle. (5) Retrofitting. This involves making localized modifications to existing mechanical and electrical equipment using new  technologies, materials, structures, and processes, with the goal of enhancing its precision, functionality, productivity, and reliability. Such repairs are classified as improveme nt-oriented, and the extent of the work required depends on how well the original equipment’s design accommodates the retrofitting process—as well as on the specific level of perfo rmance enhancement desired for the equipment. Retrofitting is also referred to as modernization or upgrading. (6) Unscheduled Maintenance. This is a level of maintenance required f or mechanical and electrical equipment due to sudden breakdowns and accidents. The fewer the number and scope of unscheduled maintenance activities, the higher the level of managem ent.",text-EN.txt
20,"Condition-Based Maintenance System It is based on reliability theory, condition monitoring, and fault diagnosis, determining the timing and scope of maintenance based on actual technical condition assessments of mechanical and electrical equipment. Given that many complex mechanical and electrical systems typically experience only early or occasional failures—without a wear-out phase—regular, scheduled maintenance often proves ineffective against such faults. Moreover, in modern mechanical and electrical systems, only a small number of component failures pose safety risks; thus, maintenance tasks should be tailored specifically to the functional requirements of each part, considering potential functional failures, their root causes, and their consequences. This maintenance approach is characterized by flexible decision-making regarding maintenance cycles, procedures, and scopes—adapting dynamically to the actual conditions of the equipment. It shifts the focus of maintenance activities from routine repairs and upkeep to proactive inspections, underpinned by the implementation of a systematic inspection system. Not only does this inspection process provide critical information for determining optimal maintenance timing and scope, but it also allows certain maintenance tasks to be carried out incrementally and efficiently. By conducting daily, periodic, and precision inspections of mechanical and electrical equipment, combined with thorough analysis of condition-monitoring and fault-diagnosis data, operators can accurately assess the degree of degradation and proactively address issues before they escalate into full-blown failures. This approach ensures that equipment remains reliably operational while maximizing the lifespan of its components—making it far more efficient and cost-effective than traditional planned preventive maintenance strategies.

Additionally, as businesses grow and expand—both in terms of product variety and output volume—process technologies inevitably evolve as well. Therefore, it is essential to promptly adjust the proportional relationships among equipment to ensure they align seamlessly with the materials being processed and the production tasks at hand. Create a favorable working environment for the equipment The working environment of machinery and equipment significantly impacts their precision and performance—especially for high-precision devices, where temperature plays a crucial role. Environmental factors such as dust, vibration, and corrosion require strict control, and it’s also essential to create optimal conditions for equipment with standard precision. Generally, direct sunlight and other forms of thermal radiation should be avoided, as should excessively humid environments, areas with high dust levels, or locations exposed to corrosive gases. Additionally, the equipment should be kept away from devices that generate significant vibrations. 3. Reliable Power Supply Assurance To avoid significant power fluctuations (exceeding ±10%) and potential transient interference signals, precision equipment typically relies on dedicated power lines—such as a separate circuit routed directly from the low-voltage distribution room—or incorporates additional voltage-stabilizing devices. Both of these measures can significantly reduce electrical interference. 4. Properly Manage Equipment Workload",text-EN.txt

Practical experience has shown that many equipment failures can be significantly reduced simply by following establi shed operating procedures. 7. Pre-employment Training for Operators Operators must be thoroughly familiar with and proficient in the equipment’s performance, structure, processing  capabilities, and maintenance procedures. New operators are required to undergo a technical assessment before operating the machine; only those who pass can independently perform s etup tasks. For precision, complex, or critical production equipment, designated operators with specialized expertise should be assigned—adhering to the principle of  ""designated personnel for specific machines, operating only with proper certification.

Overall, maintaining mechanical and electrical equipment requires meeting four fundamental criteria: neatness, cleanliness, lubrication, and saf ety. Developing clear equipment operation and maintenance procedures is a crucial step in ensuring that all subsequent operations are carried out systematically and efficiently. Th e principles for creating these operational and maintenance guidelines are outlined below. (1) General guidelines should list precautions according to the equipment operation seque nce, as well as before, during, and after shifts—aiming for concise, clear, and practical content. (2) List the structural features, processing range, operational precautions, main tenance requirements, and more separately by equipment category, making it easier for operators to grasp the key points and ensure proper implementation.

(1) Operators must wear appropriate personal protective equipment as required during operation. When inspectin g or approaching the equipment, they should avoid wearing loose-fitting clothing. Female employees are not permitted to wear long hair loose. (2) Before starting work, clear the wo rkspace. Before turning on the equipment, inspect each operating handle and control device according to the items specified in the daily inspection checklist to ensure they are in  the off position. Check whether any components show signs of severe wear, damage requiring replacement, or loose connections posing safety risks. Verify that all safety protection  devices are intact and securely fastened. Also, confirm that the power supply is functioning properly and keep a detailed inspection record. If any issues are found that fail to me et safety standards, promptly submit safety improvement suggestions or solutions to the workshop supervisor to prevent the equipment from operating while faulty. (3) Check whether  the wires and control cabinets are damaged, whether the surrounding environment is reliable, and whether the equipment's grounding or earthing facilities are safe. If any issues ar e detected, take protective measures immediately. (4) Check the oil quality and level in lubrication and hydraulic systems; replenish oil according to the lubrication chart, ensuri ng the oil remains clean, the oil lines are unobstructed, and lubrication is optimal. Proper lubrication not only guarantees effective cooling and heat dissipation but also provide s sealing and protective functions. Additionally, it plays a significant role in cleaning away contaminants and reducing wear. (5) After confirming that all components are function ing correctly, you may first run the machine at low speed for 3–5 minutes with no load. Ensure that all parts operate smoothly and are well-lubricated before proceeding with actual  work. Never exceed the recommended load or use the equipment outside of specified guidelines. (6) While the equipment is running, it is strictly prohibited to adjust the workpiece  by hand or to perform lubrication, remove debris, or wipe down the machine. When leaving the machine tool, always turn off the power supply. During operation, closely monitor the  condition of all components; if any abnormalities are detected, immediately stop the machine and address the issue. (7) When maintaining, servicing, or cleaning equipment and instr uments, ensure that the equipment and instruments are powered down and the power supply is completely turned off. Additionally, clearly display or hang warning signs at the work si te to indicate that the equipment is undergoing maintenance or repair, or that personnel are present for ongoing work. (8) Before maintenance and servicing, personnel should be awa re of the precautions specific to this task and follow the proper maintenance procedures. During maintenance, staff must remain fully focused, wear appropriate safety gear, and ens ure their standing position is secure.

(12) It is strictly prohibited to use flammable or volatile substances for wiping equipment. Oil-soaked rags must not be left on the equipment, and no flammable o r explosive materials are allowed to be stored near the equipment. (13) When working in flammable and explosive hazard areas, appropriate safety measures must be taken beforehand a nd approved by the production safety department and management before proceeding. Additionally, when welding or grinding containers or pipelines containing flammable, explosive, or  toxic materials, these must first be properly purged and thoroughly cleaned—and all openings must be fully opened—before work can begin. (14) The work area should be dry and clean . Used oil and waste rags must not be discarded randomly on the floor. Raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished goods must be neatly stacked, and blocking passageways is  strictly prohibited. (15) Regularly maintain the cleanliness of lubrication and hydraulic systems. Keep the tank lid securely closed, ensuring no water, dust, metal chips, or othe r contaminants enter the oil tank or electrical equipment.

(1) Daily Maintenance (Routine Maintenance). Its main tasks include: inspecting and lubricating the equipment; strictly following the equipment  operation procedures. Cheng uses the equipment to tighten any loose parts; cleans and wipes down the equipment, checks its operational status, and records the condition in the shi ft handover log. This type of maintenance is relatively simple, with most tasks performed on the equipment's surface. Daily maintenance should be carried out by the operating perso nnel. (2) First-Level Maintenance (Monthly Maintenance). The main tasks include: disassembling specified components such as the housing cover and protective shields, thoroughly cle aning and wiping both the inside and outside of the equipment; inspecting and adjusting clearance gaps between parts, tightening any loose components, and replacing individual wear -and-tear parts; clearing oil passages, cleaning filters, and replacing coolant while also flushing the coolant tank; cleaning guideways and sliding surfaces, removing burrs and sc ratches; and inspecting and adjusting electrical wiring and related devices. This first-level maintenance is performed after the equipment has been running for 1 to 2 months (under  a two-shift system), primarily by operational staff with support from maintenance technicians. (3) Second-Level Maintenance (Annual Maintenance). In addition to the tasks included  in first-level maintenance, second-level maintenance also involves repairing or replacing worn parts, adjusting clearances in components such as guides, maintaining the electrical  system, and inspecting and fine-tuning equipment accuracy. This type of maintenance is carried out once a year after the equipment has been in operation, primarily by maintenance  technicians with the participation of operators. 1.2.6 Equipment Fault Diagnosis Technology When equipment malfunctions, certain characteristics change accordingly, leading to vari ations in mechanical, thermal, acoustic, and electromagnetic physical and chemical parameters—each carrying distinct types of information. By capturing these altered indicators, de tecting the underlying signals and patterns, and analyzing their causes and anomalies, fault diagnosis technology enables us to pinpoint the location, nature, and severity of the f ailure, as well as forecast future issues, assess damage conditions, make informed decisions, eliminate potential hazards, and ultimately prevent accidents from occurring. This is  precisely what fault diagnosis technology aims to achieve. Mechatronic System Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance Case Studies Tutorial",text-EN.txt
30,"16 1. Equipment Fault Diagnosis Process Equipment fault diagnosis encompasses three key areas: condition monitoring, analytical diagnosis, and fault prediction. The specific implementation process can be summarized into the following four steps. 1) Signal Acquisition During operation, equipment inevitably experiences changes in various quantities such as force, heat, vibration, and energy, generating a wide range of distinct information. Depending on specific diagnostic needs, it is crucial to select signals that accurately reflect the equipment's operational status—such as vibration, pressure, or temperature—since these signals are typically captured using different types of sensors. 2) Signal Processing This is the process of classifying and processing the collected signals to extract features that accurately represent the machine's characteristics—also known as feature extraction. For example, transforming a vibration signal from the time domain to the frequency domain for spectral analysis is part of this process. 3) State Recognition The device's characteristic parameters, obtained after signal processing, are compared with the specified allowable or discriminant parameters to determine the device's condition. The current status—whether a fault exists, and if so, its type and nature. To address this, appropriate identification criteria and diagnostic strategies should be carefully developed. 4) Diagnostic Decision-making",text-EN.txt
31,"Based on the assessment of the equipment's current status, determine the appropriate responses and actions to take. At the same time, forecast how the equipment's condition may evolve based on existing signals, and conduct a trend analysis to anticipate future developments. The above four steps form a cycle; often, a complex or challenging fault cannot be correctly identified in just one cycle. Instead, it requires multiple iterations of the diagnostic process (as shown in Figure 1.1), gradually deepening both your understanding and the accuracy of your assessments—only then can the issue ultimately be resolved. Figure 1.1: Fault Diagnosis Process",text-EN.txt
32,"Equipment Fault Diagnosis Levels Equipment fault diagnosis is generally divided into two levels: simple diagnosis and precision diagnosis. Most equipment faults can be identified using simple diagnostic techniques, making this approach the foundation of diagnostic work. Precision diagnostic techniques are only employed when simple diagnostics fail to pinpoint the issue.

Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance 17",text-EN.txt
34,"(5) The collected fault signals need to be stored and documented. Regular or online monitoring in equipment condition monitoring also falls under the category of simplified diagnostic techniques. It primarily involves checking specific parameters that reflect the equipment's technical condition to determine whether everything is functioning properly. If any abnormalities are detected or if parameters exceed predefined limits, the equipment should automatically trigger an alarm or shut down. However, condition monitoring differs from identifying and diagnosing actual faults. The simplified diagnostic method is suitable for the installation and commissioning phase, used to inspect and eliminate defects caused during transportation and installation work. It is also applicable during the maintenance phase for condition monitoring, enabling early detection of potential hazards and providing insights into the equipment's degradation trends. 2) Precision Diagnostic Technology Precision diagnostic technology uses sophisticated instruments and methods to provide a detailed evaluation of equipment that is difficult to diagnose accurately with simpler techniques. It typically includes: (1) Utilize a variety of sophisticated diagnostic analysis instruments or specialized diagnostic equipment. (2) Conducted on-site at the production facility and in the diagnostic center by experienced engineering technicians and experts. (3) Identify the location of equipment failures, determine their root causes, and perform a quantitative diagnosis of the failure types. (4) The technical knowledge and work experience involved are relatively complex, requiring collaboration across multiple disciplines. (5) Perform advanced signal processing and, if necessary, predict equipment lifespan. Precision diagnostic technologies are used not only in the development and design of equipment but, increasingly, during the operation and maintenance phases. For devices that have already undergone preliminary diagnostics and been identified as exhibiting anomalies or malfunctions, these advanced techniques further pinpoint the specific locations, root causes, and types of failures—enabling more accurate and targeted repairs. It facilitates making repair decisions. Since it involves higher costs, it’s typically used in advance only when a simple diagnosis fails to provide a clear answer.",text-EN.txt
35,"1.2.7 Patterns of Failure Occurrence Mechanical and electrical equipment failures exhibit two notable characteristics: first, the likelihood of failure increases as the equipment ages; second, failures occur randomly, making it difficult to predict the exact timing of any given failure. Consequently, over the equipment's lifespan, the probability of a failure can be expressed using statistical methods.

Most failures occur at times and frequencies that correlate with the machine's The usage time of electrical equipment is closely linked. Engineering practice Experience and experimentation show that the failure rate of机电 equipment varies. Divided into the early failure phase, the random failure phase, and the wear-out failure phase. It consists of 3 stages, as shown in Figure 1.2. 1. Early Failure Phase The early failure period is characterized by a higher failure rate, but The failure rate decreases rapidly as the equipment's operating time increases. Early failures are typically caused by design or manufacturing defects. Figure 1.2: The Bathtub Curve of Failure Rates—A Case Study Tutorial on Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechatronic Systems 18",text-EN.txt
38,"Due to various reasons, the early failure period may reappear after major equipment repairs or upgrades. 2. Random Failure Period During the random failure period, the failure rate remains low and stable, nearly constant. Random failures are caused by偶然 factors—they are unpredictable and cannot be eliminated even by extending the running-in phase. Design flaws, component defects, inadequate maintenance, and improper operation can all lead to random failures. 3. Wear-Out Failure Phase The characteristic of wear-out failures is that the failure rate increases as operating time accumulates. Wear-out failures are caused by factors such as wear fatigue, aging, and corrosion of equipment components. These types of failures typically indicate that the equipment is approaching its major overhaul period or nearing the end of its service life. 1.3 Failure Modes of Mechanical Components and Corresponding Countermeasures During equipment operation, the phenomenon where mechanical components lose their intended functionality due to various factors such as design, materials, manufacturing processes, and assembly—rendering them unable to continue working—is referred to as failure. When critical components of machinery fail, it indicates that the equipment has entered a state of malfunction. Machine failures are inherently linked to the failure of mechanical parts. Given the wide variety of mechanical equipment types, along with significant differences in operating conditions and environmental factors, the failure modes of mechanical components also vary widely. Among these, the four most common and representative failure modes are wear, corrosion, deformation, and fracture. 1.3.1 Wear of Mechanical Components Wear of mechanical components is the primary failure mode for parts. In typical mechanical equipment, approximately 80% of failed or scrapped components are due to wear-related issues. Wear not only reduces the efficiency and reliability of机电设备 but can also lead to premature failure of the equipment itself. Therefore, conducting research into the wear mechanisms of机电设备 can help us understand the specific wear characteristics of various components, providing a solid foundation for developing effective maintenance strategies and schedules—and ultimately extending the service life of the equipment. 1. General Patterns of Part Wear Wear is a microscopic and dynamic process that occurs as parts wear down. Various physical, chemical, and mechanical phenomena occur, along with their external manifestations. The state refers to the wear of the surface material, and the extent of wear is typically measured by abrasion. Measure, measure. Under normal operating conditions, the wear process of the part is divided into 3 stages. Phase, as shown in Figure 1.3, where w represents the wear amount. 1) Fitting-in Phase OA It occurs during the initial phase of equipment use.

39,"The degree is very high. Choose a reasonable running-in load, relative motion speed, and lubrication. Slip conditions and other parameters are key to shortening the break-in period. 2) Stable Wear Phase AB The wear characteristic of this stage is a low and stable wear rate, which is why the duration of this phase is relatively long. But by mid- Figure 1.3: Wear Characteristic Curve –  Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance 19 Later on, the wear rate becomes relatively faster, but the equipment can still fu nction for a while. When the wear amount reaches point B, the wear rate sharply accelerates, marking the onset of the severe wear phase. Proper usage, along with regular maintenanc e and upkeep of the equipment, is key to extending this critical stage. 3) Rapid Wear Phase BC Once this stage is reached, significant changes in friction conditions occur, such as  altered lubrication or shifts in the geometric dimensions of components. Changes, such as increased clearance between mating parts and the generation of impact loads, can cause we ar rates to rise sharply. At this point, mechanical efficiency noticeably declines, and precision deteriorates—conditions that, if left unaddressed, could lead to equipment failure  or even unexpected accidents. Therefore, promptly identifying and repairing components that are about to enter this stage is critically important. According to wear results, wear  is categorized into pitting wear, adhesive wear, abrasive wear, and more; while based on wear mechanisms, it is classified into abrasive wear, fatigue wear, adhesive wear, fretting  wear, and others. Abrasive wear occurs when a hard protruding part on one surface of a friction pair comes into contact with the other surface, or when abrasive particles are pres ent between the two rubbing surfaces. Wear occurs when hard particulates—such as dust in the air or metal particles generated by abrasion—cause material transfer from one surface t o another, or even simultaneous material loss on both surfaces, during relative motion. Among the many wear failure modes, abrasive wear is not only the most common but also the mo st severe type of failure. Fretting wear refers to a type of wear where localized areas on the surfaces of friction pairs develop fatigue cracks under cyclic contact stresses, lead ing to the detachment of micro-sheets or particles. Depending on the nature of contact and relative motion between the friction pairs, fretting wear can be categorized into two mai n forms: rolling-contact fatigue wear and sliding-contact fatigue wear. In practical applications, pure rolling-contact fatigue wear is relatively rare; most often, it occurs as a  combination of rolling and sliding motions. Adhesive wear occurs when, at the points of contact between mating surfaces,  ""cold welding "" takes place, causing material from one surface to transfer to the other during relative sliding. Micro-motion wear is a type of wear that occurs when two contacting objects under go relative vibrations with very small amplitudes. It happens on two closely matched surfaces that appear nominally stationary but actually experience cyclic, minute-scale relative  sliding—typically at the micrometer level (2–20 μm). For instance, this phenomenon can be observed at interference or transition-fit interfaces between shafts and holes, on keyway  surfaces, or in threaded fasteners. Wear occurring on working surfaces, such as the working surface of the rivet, and other similar areas. Fretting wear not only reduces mating ac curacy, loosens tight-fitting components, and degrades the quality of the mating surfaces, but can also lead to the formation of fatigue cracks, significantly diminishing the fatig ue strength of the part. 2. Measures to Prevent or Reduce Wear",text-EN.txt
40,"According to theoretical studies on wear, combined with practical production experience, the methods and approaches t o prevent or reduce wear can be summarized into the following areas. Lubrication Choosing the right lubricant and lubrication method, and replacing dry friction with ideal fluid friction, is the most effective way to reduce friction and wear. Correctly selecting materials Selecting the right materials based on their fundamental wear characteristics is one of the key factors in enhancing wear resistance. High fatigue strength, excellent corrosion resistance, and superior wear and high-temperature performance should be prioritized when choosing new steel grades or advanced materials. Additionally, it’s important to consider the compatibility between mating materials to ensure they form an optimal combination.

This is one of the most effective and cost-efficient approaches available. 4) Rational structural design Proper and rational structural design is an effective way to reduce wear and enhance wear resistance. The structure should facilitate the formation and restoration of protective surface films between friction pairs, ensure uniform pressure distribution, promote efficient dissipation of frictional heat, enable smooth removal of wear debris, and prevent the ingress of external abrasive particles and dust. In structural design, the principle of substitution can be applied—allowing one component in the system to wear while protecting another critical part—or the principle of transfer, where one member of the friction pair is intentionally worn more rapidly to safeguard the other.

During the initial phase of machinery use, ensure proper running-in procedures are followed. Whenever possible, leverage advanced monitoring and testing technologies.",text-EN.txt
44,"1.3.2 Corrosion of Metal Parts In the field of engineering, metal corrosion leads to enormous economic losses—estimates suggest that globally, steel and equipment scrapped annually due to corrosion account for approximately 30% of the world’s annual steel production. Corrosion is the process by which metals are damaged as a result of interactions with their surrounding environment, typically occurring when metal components undergo chemical or electrochemical reactions under specific environmental conditions. Corrosive damage always begins at the metal’s surface, gradually progressing inward—sometimes rapidly, sometimes more slowly—leading to material loss, degradation of surface quality, and even internal crystal structure damage. This ultimately results in irregularly shaped defects such as pits and spots, severely compromising the component’s integrity and eventually causing it to fail. Metal corrosion is broadly classified into two main categories based on its mechanism and underlying processes: chemical corrosion and electrochemical corrosion. Chemical Corrosion of Metal Parts Chemical corrosion of metals is caused by purely chemical reactions. When the surface material of a metal part interacts chemically with harmful components present in surrounding gases or non-electrolytic liquids, a corrosion layer forms on the metal surface. As this layer continuously flakes off and regenerates, the part gradually deteriorates. The primary harmful substances that react chemically with mechanical components include gases like O₂, H₂S, and SO₂, as well as certain corrosive byproducts found in lubricating oils. Among these, the chemical reaction between iron and oxygen is the most common form of chemical corrosion. Erosion, the process is as follows.",text-EN.txt
45,"4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃ 3Fe + 2O₂ → Fe₃O₄ Corrosion products such as Fe₂O₃ or Fe₃O₄ typically form a protective film that coats the metal surface. During friction, Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment 21 After the surface oxide film is worn away, the friction surface quickly reacts with the oxidizing medium, forming a new oxide layer that is subsequently removed during the friction  process. This cyclical process ultimately leads to metal corrosion. A key characteristic of oxidative wear is the presence of uniform, fine grooves aligned along the sliding direc tion on the friction surface, accompanied by reddish-brown flaky Fe₂O₃ or grayish-black filamentous Fe₃O₄ debris. Debris is generated. The primary factors influencing oxidative wea r are the density and integrity of the oxide film, as well as how firmly it adheres to the substrate. If the oxide film is dense, intact, free of pores, and strongly bonded to the  metal substrate, it exhibits excellent wear resistance, resists being worn away easily, and effectively helps prevent corrosion of the metal surface. 2. Electrochemical Corrosion o f Metal Parts Electrochemical corrosion is a complex physical and chemical process of corrosion. It can be defined as the continuous, charge-driven chemical corrosion that occurs w hen two metal electrodes with a potential difference are immersed in an electrolyte solution. This type of corrosion happens when metals come into contact with electrolytic substan ces, and its key distinction from ordinary chemical corrosion lies in the fact that it involves the flow of electric current during the process. The fundamental conditions necessar y for electrochemical corrosion to occur are: ① the presence of two or more objects with differing electrode potentials—or, within a single object, regions exhibiting different ele ctrode potentials—that act as positive and negative electrodes; ② a conductive pathway connecting the electrodes, either through a conductor or direct contact, allowing charges in  the corrosion zone to flow freely; and ③ the simultaneous presence of an electrolyte solution. Common forms of electrochemical corrosion include the following: (1) Uniform corrosio n. When a metal part or component exhibits a uniform corrosion pattern across its surface, it is referred to as uniform corrosion. This type of corrosion can occur in liquids, the  atmosphere, or soil. Among mechanical equipment, the most common form of uniform corrosion is atmospheric corrosion. In industrial areas, the atmosphere often contains higher conce ntrations of corrosive gases such as CO₂, SO₂, H₂S, NO₂, and Cl₂. Additionally, airborne dust particles may carry acidic, alkaline, or saline micro-particles, which, when adhering  to the surface of components, can absorb moisture from the air and form an electrolyte, ultimately leading to corrosion on the part's surface. (2) Pitting corrosion. On most surfac es of metal components, corrosion either doesn’t occur at all or is very mild; however, localized areas develop small corrosion pits that penetrate deeply into the material. This t ype of corrosion is known as pitting corrosion. Because metals used in industry often contain extremely tiny microelectrodes, they are highly susceptible to pitting corrosion when  exposed to aqueous solutions or humid environments. In the case of steel components, when pitting corrosion occurs alongside uniform corrosion, the corrosion spots can easily becom e obscured by the porous structure formed during uniform corrosion, making them difficult to detect and identify. As a result, pitting corrosion is one of the most dangerous forms  of corrosion. (3) Crevice corrosion. In机电 equipment, gaps exist between various connected components—typically ranging from 0.025 to 0.1 mm. When corrosive media enter these gaps a nd remain trapped, localized corrosion can occur precisely at the crevices. For instance, this type of crevice corrosion often happens at flange faces where pipes are connected, as  well as at the riveted joints of metal rivets. (4) Corrosion Fatigue. When metallic components subjected to cyclic stress experience reduced fatigue strength or shortened fatigue  life—and ultimately fail—due to the presence of a corrosive environment, this phenomenon is known as corrosion fatigue or corrosion fatigue fracture. Corrosion fatigue can cause me tal components to fracture even under very low levels of cyclic (pulsating) stress, and often there is no clear fatigue limit. As a result, damage caused by corrosion fatigue tends  to be more severe than that resulting from pure mechanical fatigue alone. To prevent and reduce corrosion failures, as well as minimize their harmful effects on equipment, special  attention must be paid during the manufacturing process to correctly selecting materials for components and thoughtfully designing various structural elements. Additionally, for p arts operating in corrosive environments, advanced anti-corrosion measures such as surface coating technologies, electrochemical protection techniques, and the addition of corrosio n inhibitors should be employed to ensure that these components remain protected—or at least minimally affected—by corrosive agents.",text-EN.txt
46,"3. Cavitation When a part comes into contact wi th a liquid and experiences relative motion, bubbles form at the contact point if the local pressure drops below the liquid's vapor pressure. As these bubbles move toward high-pres sure areas, they are compressed and deformed by the intense external pressure—eventually leading to their collapse. A Tutorial on Fault Diagnosis and Repair of Electro-Mechanical Systems Involving Bubble Formation 22 When bubbles are forced to collapse, their rapid implosion—at speeds as high a s 250 m/s—immediately generates an enormous impact force and extremely high temperatures. Under the combined effects of this intense force and extreme heat, localized liquids can e ject tiny jets of liquid outward. This phenomenon is known as cavitation. If a bubble collapses right at the surface of a component, the surface itself comes under direct impact from these microjets. Over time, as bubbles repeatedly form and burst in close proximity to the surface, the material on the component’s surface is continuously bombarded by these high-speed liquid jets. This relentless erosion eventually leads to fatigue, causing the material to gradually flake off—initially forming small pitting marks that, over time, expand into a sponge-like, foam-like texture. This process is commonly referred to as cavitation damage. Cavitation is a relatively complex destructive phenomenon that involves not only mechanical effects but also chemical and electrochemical processes. This destructive process is exacerbated when the liquid contains impurities or abrasive particles. Cavitation commonly occurs on the outer walls of diesel engine cylinder liners, pump components, turbine blades, and hydraulic pumps, among other areas. Measures to reduce cavitation primarily include: (1) To reduce the occurrence of water hammer by minimizing vibrations on surfaces in contact with liquids, methods such as increasing rigidity, improving support systems, and implementing vibration-damping measures can be employed. (2) Select materials resistant to cavitation, such as cast iron with spherical or nodular graphite, stainless steel, nylon, and others. (3) Parts can be coated with anti-cavitation materials such as plastic or ceramic, or they can also be surface-chromed. (4) Improve the part structure, reduce surface roughness values, and minimize vortex formation during liquid flow. (5) Add emulsified oil to the water to reduce the impact force during bubble bursts. 1.3.3 Deformation of Mechanical Parts In practice, it often happens that although worn parts have been repaired and restored to their original dimensions, shape, and fit, the equipment still fails to achieve its original technical performance after assembly. This is usually due to deformation of the parts, particularly It is caused by the deformation of basic components, which disrupts the positional accuracy between parts and, in turn, affects the relationships among the individual components. Deformation in mechanical parts or components can be categorized into two types: elastic deformation and plastic deformation. Elastic Deformation Elastic deformation is the type of deformation that fully recovers once the external force is removed. After a material undergoes elastic deformation, it may exhibit an elastic aftereffect: when the external force is suddenly released, the strain doesn’t vanish entirely right away—it disappears only partially, with the remaining portion gradually dissipating over time. This phenomenon, where the strain lags behind the applied stress, is known as the elastic aftereffect. The extent of the elastic aftereffect depends on factors such as the material’s properties, the magnitude of the stress, its initial state, and the temperature. Specifically, the more non-uniform the metal’s microstructure, the greater the applied stress, and the higher the temperature, the more pronounced the elastic aftereffect will be. Typically, after straightening, shaft-like components tend to bend again after some time—this is a clear manifestation of the elastic aftereffect. To eliminate this phenomenon, one effective method is to perform prolonged tempering, which ensures that residual stresses are completely relieved within a short period. Plastic Deformation Plastic deformation refers to the type of deformation that does not fully recover once the external force is removed. Its key characteristics include: ① it leads to changes in the material's microstructure and properties, resulting in work hardening of the metal; ② since polycrystalline materials undergo uneven deformation across individual grains and even within the same grain during plastic deformation, the elastic recovery of each grain differs after the external force is removed, leading to residual stresses; ③ plastic deformation enhances atomic mobility, thereby reducing the metal's corrosion resistance. Plastic deformation of metal parts, viewed from macroscopic morphological features, includes volume deformation, warping deformation, and aging deformation. Volume deformation refers to the phenomenon where metal parts expand or contract in volume due to changes in thermal capacity caused by phase transformations during heating and cooling processes. Warping deformation, on the other hand, involves plastic deformation that results in bending or twisting of the part, with the primary cause being failures outlined in Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance. 23 It involves deformations of various types (such as bending, torsion, tension-compression, etc.) and in different directions. These deformations are commonly observed in slender shaft-like, thin plate-shaped components, as well as in thin-walled annular and sleeve-type parts. Age-related deformation is caused by changes in stress. 3. Measures to Prevent and Reduce Deformation of Mechanical Parts Deformation is inevitable, but appropriate measures can be taken from the following four areas to prevent and minimize mechanical part deformation. 1) Design aspect",text-EN.txt
47,"When designing, it's essential to consider not only the strength of the parts but also their stiffness, as well as issues related to manufacturing, assembly, usage, disassembly, and maintenance. (1) Select materials carefully, paying attention to their process properties—such as casting fluidity and shrinkage, forging ductility and cold-heading capability, weldability characteristics like susceptibility to cold and hot cracking, machinability for ease of cutting, and heat-treatment properties including hardenability and resistance to cold brittleness. (2) Properly arrange the parts to optimize their stress distribution. Select appropriate structural dimensions, ensuring uniform wall thicknesses as much as possible, and minimize deformation during hot working processes. For instance, avoid sharp corners by replacing them with rounded or chamfered edges; for areas with significant thickness variations, consider adding process holes or reinforcing excessively thin sections. Additionally, carefully position any existing holes—transforming blind holes into through-holes where feasible. For parts with complex geometries, whenever possible, opt for modular or assembled designs to further enhance stress management. (3) In the design process, ensure the application of new technologies, processes, and materials to minimize internal stresses and deformation during manufacturing. 2) Manufacturing In the rough casting manufacturing process, it is important to address deformation issues and implement various process measures to minimize residual stresses in the blank. After the raw parts are produced and during subsequent machining processes, it is essential to incorporate sufficient steps for relieving internal stresses, aiming to minimize residual stresses within the components. One effective method to eliminate these residuals is through aging treatment, which can be either natural or artificial. Natural aging involves leaving the finished raw parts exposed outdoors for 1 to 2 years. This approach leverages the material’s inherent property of gradually releasing internal stresses over a period of 12 to 20 months—making it particularly effective—but the main drawback is the excessively long aging cycle. On the other hand, artificial aging accelerates the stress-relief process by subjecting the parts to high-temperature annealing followed by controlled cooling at a slow pace. Alternatively, vibrational techniques can also be employed to achieve artificial aging. For high-precision components, artificial aging must be integrated into the final machining stages to ensure optimal dimensional accuracy and stability. During machining and repair processes, minimize the number of datum shifts, preserving the original machining datums for use during maintenance, thereby reducing repair time. Errors caused by inconsistent benchmarks during machining. For parts that have undergone heat treatment, be sure to allow sufficient machining allowances and adjust the machining dimensions accordingly. Pre-applying controlled deformation is crucial—once the deformation patterns of the part are understood, you can counteract them in advance by introducing an equal but opposite amount of deformation. Alternatively, you can pre-stress the part or carefully manage the generation and evolution of stresses, ensuring that the final deformation aligns with specifications and effectively minimizes distortion. 3) Maintenance Aspects During maintenance, it is essential to not only meet the technical requirements—such as restoring part dimensions, ensuring proper fit tolerances, and achieving high surface quality—but also to inspect and correct any shape or positional errors in critical components. To minimize stress and deformation of parts during repair, standardized guidelines and maintenance procedures specifically addressing deformation issues should be established. Additionally, simple, reliable, and user-friendly specialized measuring tools and fixtures should be designed. Finally, it’s important to actively promote ""three new"" technologies, particularly innovative repair techniques like brush plating and bonding. 4) Usage Instructions",text-EN.txt
48,"Usage guidelines include strengthening equipment management, establishing and rigorously enforcing operating procedures, enhancing inspection and maintenance of mechanical equipment, avoiding overloading, and preventing localized overloads or overheating.

49,"1.3.4 Fracture of Mechanical Parts Fracture refers to the phenomenon where a mechanical component develops localized cracks or splits into several parts under the influence of certain factors. It is one of the primary modes of mechanical component failure—once a part fractures, it not only completely loses its functionality but can also lead to significant economic losses and even cause accidents resulting in injuries or fatalities. Particularly as modern manufacturing systems continue to evolve toward higher power levels and faster rotational speeds, the operating conditions for components have changed dramatically, increasing the likelihood of fracture-related failures. As a result, fracture failure has become a hot topic of research today. The fracture surface formed after a part breaks can accurately capture the dynamic evolution of the failure process. By analyzing the fracture surface, it is possible to identify the primary cause of the fracture, providing valuable insights that help refine designs and enable effective repairs. Based on the cause of failure, fractures can be categorized into types such as brittle fracture and fatigue fracture. Brittle Fracture Before fracturing, the component exhibits no noticeable plastic deformation; this type of fracture, which develops extremely rapidly, is known as brittle fracture.  Brittle fracture occurs without any prior warning signs, making it a sudden and highly dangerous form of failure. Metal parts may become brittle—and thus prone to sudden fracture— due to improper manufacturing processes, exposure to corrosive media during use, or adverse environmental conditions. For instance, the penetration of hydrogen or hydrides into met al materials can lead to  ""hydrogen embrittlement, "" while chloride ions infiltrating austenitic stainless steel may cause  ""chloride stress corrosion cracking. "" Similarly, nitrate ions entering carbon steel can trigger  ""nitrate embrittlement, "" and steel in contact with alkaline substances might suffer from  ""alkali embrittlement. "" Additionally, copper components exposed to ammonia can experience  ""ammonia-induced embrittlement. "" Furthermore, at ambient temperatures between 10°C and 15°C, medium- to low-strength carbon steels are particularly susceptible to  ""cold embrittlement "" (often caused by elevated phosphorus content in the steel). Meanwhile, aluminum-containing alloys, if not carefully temperature-controlled during heat treatment, can easily overh eat—even with only a slight deviation from the optimal range—leading to severe embrittlement. The hazards posed by brittle fracture in metals are significant, second only to those  associated with fatigue failure. Fatigue Fracture The fracture phenomenon that occurs in metal parts after being subjected to a certain number of cyclic loads or alternating stresses is known as fatigue failure. In fact, 80% of fractures in mechanical components during use are caused by fatigue. Typically, fatigue failure progresses through three distinct stages: the initiation phase of fatigue cracks; the propagation phase of fatigue cracks; and finally, catastrophic failure—the unstable, rapid growth phase of the fatigue crack. Below, we will analyze the fracture surfaces associated with fatigue failure. A typical fatigue fracture typically exhibits 3 distinct features based on the fracture process. Regions with distinct characteristics: fatigue core zone, fatigue crack propagation Zone and transient zone, as shown in Figure 1.4. Fatigue Core Zone It is the source region of fatigue fracture, visible to the naked eye or under low magnification. A magnifying glass can pinpoint the location of the fatigue core on the fracture surface—it typically does. Appearing in the area with the lowest intensity, highest stress, and closest to the surface Position. But if there are defects inside the material, this fatigue core... It could also occur at the defect site. Scratches left behind during the machining, storage, transportation, and assembly processes are highly likely to become fatigue nuclei, as these marks not only cause stress concentrations but also remain vulnerable to corrosion damage from air and other environmental factors. Figure 1.4: Schematic Diagram of Fatigue Fracture Features (Uniaxial Bending)",text-EN.txt
50,"Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance, Page 25",text-EN.txt
51,"2) Fatigue Crack Propagation Zone This region is the most critical feature area on the fracture surface, often appearing shell-like or resembling beach ripples. Each individual line marks the trace left behind after a single crack extension event—typically corresponding to a change in applied load, such as when a machine starts up or shuts down. These lines radiate outward from the fatigue core, advancing perpendicularly to the direction of crack propagation. The smoother the crack propagation zone on the fatigue fracture surface, the more load cycles the component endured prior to failure. Conversely, the denser the shell-like lines near the instantaneous fracture zone indicate lower load magnitudes. On the other hand, if this area appears rougher, it suggests that the crack propagated rapidly under relatively high loading conditions. 3) Transient Break Zone Commonly referred to as the ""static fracture surface,"" it is the fracture region formed when a fatigue crack rapidly propagates upon reaching a critical size. Its macroscopic features closely resemble the radial zone and shear lips typically observed in fast-fracture areas of static tensile fractures. The location and size of the instantaneous fracture zone are directly influenced by the applied load—specifically, the greater the load, the closer the final fracture area moves toward the center of the fracture surface. Conversely, a smaller fracture area indicates that the component was subjected to a lower load. 3. Fracture Failure Analysis",text-EN.txt
52,"The steps for fracture failure analysis are generally as follows. 1) On-site recording and photography After a major equipment accident occurs, promptly investigate and understand all circumstances before and after the incident, and take photographs or videos if necessary. Unless there are casualties requiring immediate attention, efforts should be made to preserve the scene as much as possible. 2) Analyze the dominant failure component When a critical component fails due to fracture, it often leads to the failure of other related parts and structural elements. In such cases, it’s essential to carefully determine the sequence of events and accurately identify the primary fracture-causing component—otherwise, the analysis results could be misleading. 3) Identify the dominant crack on the primary failure component The dominant failure component may already be fragmented; therefore, the remaining fragments should be collected, carefully pieced together, and analyzed to identify which crack initiated first—this crack is the dominant one. 4) Identifying the Failure Source Area Once the dominant crack is identified, you can then examine the corresponding fracture surface to locate the crack initiation zone. 5) Fracture Surface Treatment If further microscopic analysis of the fracture surface is required, or if it’s necessary to preserve evidence, the fracture surface should be cleaned. Typically, clean with compressed air or alcohol, then dry thoroughly afterward. If long-term storage is required, apply rust-preventive oil or grease and store in a sealed container equipped with a desiccant. 6) Determine the cause of failure",text-EN.txt
53,"When determining the failure cause of a part, consider the material properties, manufacturing process, load conditions, assembly quality, and years of use. Carefully examine and analyze factors such as the medium and temperature in the working environment, as well as the usage conditions of similar parts, before combining this information with the macroscopic and microscopic features of the fracture surface to make an accurate assessment and identify the primary and secondary causes of the failure. 7) Identify Failure Countermeasures Once the cause of failure is identified, targeted solutions are proposed to effectively leverage existing conditions and prevent fracture incidents from occurring. A Tutorial on Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance Cases for Mechatronic Systems 26",text-EN.txt
54,"4. Measures to Reduce Fracture Failure Fracture failure is one of the most dangerous forms of failure, and most metal parts fail due to various factors arising from metallurgy and part manufacturing processes. Because all of them contain cracks of varying sizes and characteristics, ranging from atomic-level dislocations to macroscopic cracks visible to the naked eye. However, a part with cracks doesn’t necessarily fail immediately—there’s typically a period during which these cracks undergo subcritical propagation. Moreover, under certain conditions, cracks may even remain stable without expanding at all. Therefore, by implementing effective measures, it’s possible to ensure that parts containing cracks do not ultimately fracture. Strategies to minimize fracture failures can be considered from the following perspectives. 1) Optimize the shape and structural design of parts, and carefully select appropriate materials for the components. Both geometric discontinuities in part shapes and material imperfections can lead to stress concentration. Geometric discontinuities are commonly referred to as notches, such as fillets at shoulders, grooves, oil holes, keyways, threads, and machining marks. Material-related discontinuities are typically called material defects, including shrinkage porosity, shrinkage cavities, non-metallic inclusions, and welding flaws. These areas prone to stress concentration are particularly susceptible to crack initiation and propagation under cyclic or impact loading, ultimately leading to fracture. Therefore, in part design, it’s crucial to minimize stress-concentration zones while carefully considering the part’s operating environment—such as the presence of corrosive media, temperature variations, and applied loads—and selecting appropriate materials accordingly. This approach helps effectively reduce the risk of fatigue failure. 2) Properly select the part machining method During various machining, welding, and heat treatment processes, residual stresses remain inside components due to factors such as plastic deformation, thermal expansion and contraction, and phase transformations occurring during these operations. Residual stresses are categorized into two types: residual tensile stress and residual compressive stress. While residual tensile stress is detrimental to component performance, residual compressive stress can significantly enhance the fatigue life of the part. Therefore, it is advisable to prioritize processes like carburizing, nitriding, shot peening, and surface rolling—methods known for generating beneficial compressive stresses—in component manufacturing. By inducing compressive stresses on the component’s surface, these techniques help counteract some of the tensile stresses caused by external loads, thereby improving the overall durability and longevity of the part. 3) Installation and Usage Instructions",text-EN.txt
55,"① Ensure proper installation to prevent the development of additional stress and vibration. For critical components, avoid dents and scratches, as even the smallest damage could become a potential fracture point. ② Care should be taken to protect the equipment's operating environment, preventing erosion from corrosive media and avoiding excessive temperature differences between its various components. ③ To prevent equipment overload, strictly follow the equipment operating procedures. ④ Take timely corrective measures for parts with cracks.",text-EN.txt
56,"1.4 Mechanical Equipment Maintenance Procedures and Implementation With the continuous advancement of new materials, processes, and technologies, repairing mechanical parts has evolved beyond simply restoring them to their original condition. Many advanced techniques now not only revive components but also enhance their performance and extend their service life. For instance, methods such as electroplating, surfacing welding, application of wear-resistant coatings, thermal spraying and flame spraying, adhesive bonding, and various surface-hardening treatments allow for the precise deposition of small amounts of high-performance materials onto part surfaces—at relatively low costs—while significantly boosting wear resistance. As a result, in the maintenance of electromechanical equipment, fully leveraging these repair techniques and carefully selecting appropriate processes can reduce downtime, cut maintenance expenses, and ultimately lead to substantial improvements in a company’s economic efficiency.

57,"1.4.1 Preparations Before Mechanical Equipment Maintenance Electromechanical equipment occupies a critically important position in the production and operational activities of modern industrial enterprises. To ensure smooth equipment operation and safe production, implementing planned preventive maintenance is an essential component of equipment management and repair practices in industrial companies. This section will cover the detailed process of major equipment overhauls, the determination of equipment repair plans, as well as the technical and material preparations required prior to equipment maintenance. 1. Equipment Major Overhaul Process To ensure the precision and operational performance of mechanical and electrical equipment, preventive scheduled maintenance must be carried out in addition to routine upkeep. Among these preventive measures, major overhauls stand out as a critical task aimed at restoring the equipment's accuracy. Within the category of preventive maintenance, major overhauls—often referred to simply as ""overhauls""—represent the most extensive and time-consuming type of repair. An overhaul involves completely or largely disassembling the equipment, repairing or replacing foundational components, refurbishing mechanical and electrical parts, recalibrating the electrical systems, and finally reassembling and fine-tuning the entire unit. The ultimate goal is to thoroughly eliminate any pre-existing defects and restore the equipment to its specified performance standards. The purpose of precision and performance. The major steps involved in the overhaul of mechanical and electrical equipment typically include: pre-disassembly unit inspection, component removal, component inspection, necessary component disassembly, parts cleaning and examination, component repair and assembly, final assembly, no-load trial operation, load testing, overall machine precision verification, and final acceptance. In practice, these tasks should be carried out according to the overhaul work plan, while also ensuring effective job scheduling, quality control during operations, and thorough completion acceptance. The major overhaul process for mechanical and electrical equipment is typically divided into three stages: pre-repair preparation, the repair process itself, and post-repair acceptance. Pre-repair preparation phase To ensure the repair work proceeds smoothly and accurately, maintenance personnel should carefully listen to operators' requirements for equipment repairs and thoroughly understand the issues affecting the equipment being serviced—such as loss of precision, the extent of wear on major mechanical components, the accuracy of the transmission system, and any visible defects. They should also identify which parts need improvement or modification to meet the equipment’s operational specifications. Additionally, they should review relevant technical documentation, equipment manuals, and previous maintenance records to become familiar with the device’s structural features, transmission system, and original design precision standards. This preparation will enable them to propose comprehensive pre-inspection tasks. Following the pre-inspection, specific repair methods for critical and large components can be determined, allowing for the preparation of specialized tools and precision measuring instruments. Finally, the team must define the post-repair precision testing procedures and establish clear acceptance criteria for trial runs, ensuring all technical preparations are fully in place before proceeding with the complete overhaul of the equipment.",text-EN.txt
58,"2) Maintenance Process Stage Once the maintenance process begins, the first step is to disassemble the equipment—following a sequence and approach that reverses the original assembly order, adhering to the principle of ""top-down and outside-in."" This systematic method carefully releases the components from their interlocking and fixed positions within the machine. After removal, each part should undergo a secondary pre-inspection. Based on the findings from this second check, any additional repair parts required will be identified. Furthermore, the availability of replacement and repaired components, along with their current status, will help establish a rough schedule for the maintenance tasks. This ensures that the repair work progresses methodically and according to plan, preventing delays caused by poor coordination in organizational efforts. The precision and performance achievable during equipment maintenance depend on factors such as the technical expertise available for repair work, the number of major overhauls the equipment has undergone, and its pre-repair technical condition. Generally speaking, for machinery undergoing its first major overhaul, both its precision and performance should ideally meet the original factory standards. However, after two or more major overhauls, the equipment’s post-repair precision and performance typically fall short of those of a new unit. That said, if the equipment was in relatively good technical condition prior to the last overhaul, it will likely be easier to restore its quality closer to the original factory standards this time around. Conversely, if the previous overhaul left the equipment in suboptimal condition, it may create significant challenges for the next major repair—and in some cases, the resulting quality might even fail to meet the original factory standards, making further repairs impractical altogether. The assembly of the complete equipment is carried out according to acceptance criteria. During assembly, appropriate reference surfaces should be selected for accurate mechanical and electrical system fault diagnosis and maintenance case studies.",text-EN.txt
59,"28 Determine the form and compensation method for the error compensation环节, ensuring assembly accuracy among all components—such as parallelism, coaxiality, perpendicularity, and the required meshing precision of the transmission. 3) Post-Repair Acceptance Phase All equipment that has undergone repair, assembly, and adjustment must be subjected to comprehensive precision checks and tests—such as geometric accuracy inspections, no-load running tests, load tests, and working precision evaluations—in accordance with the relevant prescribed accuracy standards or the precision criteria established prior to repair. These measures ensure a thorough assessment of the repaired equipment’s quality, restored precision, and overall performance. After equipment maintenance, record the modifications made to the original technical documentation and document any lessons learned during the repair process. Prepare a thorough post-repair summary and file it alongside the original documents for future reference during the next maintenance task. 2. Determining the Equipment Maintenance Plan Major equipment overhauls must not only meet the predetermined technical requirements but also strive to enhance economic efficiency. Therefore, before starting repairs, it’s essential to thoroughly assess the equipment’s technical condition, develop a practical and feasible repair plan, and ensure comprehensive preparation—both technically and in terms of production readiness. During the repair process, actively incorporate new technologies, materials, processes, and modern management techniques, while diligently managing technical, financial, and organizational aspects to guarantee high-quality workmanship, minimize downtime, and reduce overall maintenance costs. A pre-inspection must be conducted to thoroughly assess the equipment's technical condition before repairs, identify the main defects present, and analyze the product-specific process requirements that influence the equipment's technical specifications—allowing for the immediate development of a repair plan. 3. Technical Preparation Before Equipment Maintenance Preparation for equipment maintenance involves two key aspects: technical preparation and production readiness. The technical preparation prior to maintenance is the responsibility of the lead technician, and its main tasks include pre-inspection planning and research, conducting the actual pre-inspection, and preparing comprehensive overhaul technical documentation. Meanwhile, production readiness before the overhaul is managed by personnel responsible for spare parts, materials, and tools, as well as the production planners from the maintenance unit. Their primary responsibilities encompass ordering, manufacturing, inspecting, and storing critical materials, spare parts, and specialized tools, gauges, and testing equipment—along with developing the overall maintenance production schedule. Pre-inspection survey preparation work To gain a comprehensive understanding of the specific condition of equipment degradation, schedule a shutdown inspection before the major overhaul—this is referred to as a pre-inspection. Before conducting the equipment pre-inspection, ensure the following preparatory investigations are completed. (1) Review the following equipment records: factory inspection reports; precision and performance verification records from equipment installation acceptance tests; details of all past equipment incidents, malfunctions, and repairs, including any remaining issues after repairs; records of all previous maintenance activities, including replaced or repaired components, as well as any unresolved problems left behind after servicing; and operational status monitoring logs and comprehensive equipment inspection records.",text-EN.txt
60,"(2) Read the equipment manual and equipment catalog. (3) Survey equipment operators and maintenance personnel: Identify parts of the equipment that are prone to failures during operation and the underlying causes; assess the equipment’s precision and overall performance; highlight the major existing defects; and gather specific recommendations for repairs and improvements required during major overhauls. (4) Solicit input from departments such as Technology, Quality, and Production Management regarding localized equipment improvements. Pre-screening (1) The purpose of the pre-inspection. Through pre-inspection, we can comprehensively and thoroughly assess the deterioration of equipment conditions, gain a clearer understanding of how product processes affect the equipment’s precision and performance, thereby identifying which parts need to be replaced or repaired. This information then allows us to create detailed drawings or verify existing ones for these parts, ensuring they meet the requirements for manufacturing and repair work. (2) Pre-inspection content: Typically, the pre-inspection content is determined based on the equipment type and the pre-repair investigation. (3) Inspect geometric and operational accuracy item by item, according to the equipment manufacturer's precision standards and inspection methods for each country or enterprise.

61,"29 Record the measured values. (4) Check the machine tool's operational condition: Verify whether the control system responds sensitively and reliably during movement; ensure that all movements meet the specified values; and confirm that the motion is smooth, without vibrations, noise, or stick-slip phenomena. (5) Inspect the machine tool guideways, lead screws, and racks for wear, and measure the extent of the wear. (6) Inspect the hydraulic, pneumatic, and lubrication systems: Verify that movements are accurate, check for any component damage or leaks, and if leaks are present, identify the cause. (7) Inspect the electrical system: Check whether electrical components are aged or malfunctioning. (8) Inspect safety protection devices: Verify that all limit switches and interlock mechanisms are sensitive and reliable, and check whether any of the indicator instruments or protective guards are damaged. (9) Inspect the equipment's appearance and accessories: Check for chipped paint, damage to any handles, ensure all labels are present, and verify that accessories are complete and free from wear or damage. (10) Partial disassembly inspection to determine whether parts need replacement or repair based on their wear condition. During the pre-inspection, especially large and complex castings and forgings, high-precision critical components, and purchased parts must be checked one by one to determine whether they need replacement or repair. Preparing overhaul technical documentation By conducting a pre-inspection to assess the equipment's condition and determine whether repairs or component replacements are necessary, we can then proceed to analyze, develop a repair plan, and prepare the corresponding technical documentation. These technical documents serve as the foundation for major equipment overhauls. Commonly used technical documents for equipment overhauls include the following types: (1) Prepare the equipment maintenance technical specification. The equipment maintenance technical specification should include the following content. ① The technical condition of the equipment before major overhaul. ② Key maintenance activities include detailing the disassembly, cleaning, and inspection of components to identify parts that require repair or replacement; briefly outlining the r epair methods for basic and critical components; specifying mechanisms that must be thoroughly inspected and adjusted, as well as other areas requiring attention; and highlighting  specific parts and aspects that can be improved during the overhaul process. ③ Maintenance quality requirements: Specify the names and numbers of the general technical standards ap plicable to each quality inspection during major equipment overhauls, and attach the content of any specialized technical standards to the back of the task specification. (2) Prepa ring Maintenance Procedures. The maintenance procedures for mechanical equipment are the technical documents that must be carefully followed and implemented during major overhauls.  When developing overhaul procedures, it’s essential to consider the actual conditions, ensuring both technical feasibility and economic viability. Mechanical equipment overhaul pr ocedures can be categorized into two types: standard maintenance procedures and specialized maintenance procedures. The overhaul procedures for mechanical equipment typically inclu de the following elements. ① Disassembly procedures and methods for the complete machine and its components, as well as the data to be monitored and precautions to observe during t he disassembly process.",text-EN.txt
62,"② Inspection, maintenance, and assembly procedures for key components, as well as the technical specifications to be achieved. ③ The overall assembly proced ure and the precision requirements, technical specifications, and inspection/measurement methods that the assembly process must meet. ④ Adjustment processes for critical components  and the corresponding technical specifications to be achieved. ⑤ Test run procedures, specifications, and technical requirements to be achieved after final assembly. ⑥ Detailed li st of general or specialized tools, inspection and testing equipment, research fixtures, and measuring instruments required during major equipment overhauls, with specific notes in dicating items that are custom-made. ⑦ Safety measures during major overhaul operations, etc. (3) Major Maintenance Quality Standards. When accepting the repair of mechanical equip ment, reference can be made to general technical specifications for major equipment repairs established and issued by national and ministerial authorities, such as the General Tech nical Specifications for Major Repairs of Metal Cutting Machine Tools and the General Technical Specifications for Major Repairs of Forging and Pressing Equipment. Industries and e nterprises may also develop their own specialized quality standards for major equipment repairs based on these relevant general technical guidelines.

63,"If none of the above standards apply, refer to the equipment manufacturer's technical specifications. (4) Preparation of spare par ts, materials, and specialized tools, inspection equipment, and research fixtures. The lead technical personnel should promptly provide the management team with detailed lists of r eplacement parts, material specifications, as well as lists of specialized tools, inspection equipment, and research fixtures, along with relevant drawings. After verifying the inv entory, the management team will place orders or arrange for manufacturing to ensure that these items are available on time for use during major equipment overhauls. (5) Preparing  the Overhaul Work Plan. The overhaul work plan is prepared by the planning personnel in the maintenance department, who are responsible for equipment management. Personnel, chief t echnicians, and maintenance foremen (team leaders) review it together. The overhaul work plan includes: work procedures, the number of workers required for each phase and stage of  the job, along with the corresponding duration in days; requirements for seamless coordination between individual work phases; and details on projects that need to be outsourced to  external partners, including specific timeframes. A general overhaul work plan can be presented using a ""bar chart"" format, supplemented by necessary explanatory text. For overhauls of complex, high-precision, large-scale, and critical equipment, network scheduling techniques should be employed to ensure efficient resource utilization, shorten project timelines, and enhance overall economic benefits. 4. Material Preparation Before Equipment Maintenance Material preparation before equipment maintenance is a critically important task, serving as the essential logistical foundation for successful repairs. In practice, delays often occur due to insufficient availability of spare parts and components, disrupting the normal flow of maintenance work, prolonging downtime, and ultimately leading to inefficiencies and production losses. Therefore, it is imperative to strengthen material preparation efforts prior to equipment maintenance. After the lead maintenance technician has prepared detailed lists of replacement parts and materials, they should promptly hand these over to the responsible personnel managing spare parts and supplies. Once the inventory has been verified, these managers will place orders accordingly. Meanwhile, after finalizing the repair procedures, the lead maintenance technician must immediately provide the tool management team with detailed lists and drawings of specialized tools, inspection devices, and testing equipment. The tool management staff will then cross-check the existing inventory and forward any necessary items—such as specialized tools, inspection devices, or testing equipment—to the relevant departments for evaluation. Based on the evaluation results, if repairs are indeed required, the departments will arrange for the necessary maintenance activities. Additionally, the tool management team will initiate new procurement requests for any additional specialized tools, inspection devices, or testing equipment that may be needed. 1.4.2 General Process for Mechanical Equipment Maintenance",text-EN.txt

For machine tools that do not undergo a load test, accuracy verification should be performed after the no-load running test. 2. Precision Inspection of Mechanical Equipment Maintenance After major overhauls of mechanical equipment, acceptance checks are conducted according to established standards, with each type of equipment having its own specific acceptance criteria and inspection methods. Take metal cutting machine tools as an example: the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has established various precision testing standards for different types of machine tools, along with general guidelines for machine tool accuracy verification. Similarly, China has developed its own standards that are either equivalent to or closely aligned with international benchmarks. These standards specify the inspection items, criteria, methods, and tolerances for machine tool accuracy—serving as the fundamental basis for conducting precision tests. Currently, machine tool maintenance is carried out based on both geometric and operational precision standards during acceptance procedures. Inspection of Machine Tool Geometric Accuracy Geometric accuracy of machine tools refers to the precision of the components that ultimately affect the machine's operational accuracy. It encompasses individual accuracies of basic structural elements, positional accuracy between various parts, as well as motion accuracy, positioning accuracy, indexing accuracy, and transmission chain accuracy. Typically, geometric accuracy checks are performed while the machine tool is stationary. Before conducting these inspections, it’s essential to first ensure proper installation and leveling. Follow the machine tool’s instruction manual carefully to install the equipment on a suitable foundation and achieve precise leveling. The primary goal of leveling is to guarantee the machine’s static stability, which facilitates accurate measurements during testing—especially those related to the straightness of machine components. Additionally, national standards have standardized methods for inspecting both geometric and operational accuracy of machine tools, providing a reliable reference for conducting geometric accuracy tests. Machine Tool Testing Since the geometric accuracy of machine tools is checked under static conditions, it cannot fully reflect the quality of machine tool maintenance. To determine  whether a machine tool can maintain its original geometric accuracy under operational conditions and load applications, it must be evaluated through various machine tool tests. Th e key components of machine tool maintenance testing include no-load running tests, load tests, and working precision tests. (1) No-load operation test of the machine tool. The pur pose of the no-load operation test is to further verify the correct functioning of each component of the machine tool. Sex, reliability, ease and normality of operation, as well as  whether the temperature rise and noise levels of each moving component are within acceptable limits. The primary focus of the machine tool's no-load running test is to simultaneou sly check the operational status of relevant parts while testing the spindle and feed speeds. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Mai ntenance 35 Before conducting the no-load operation test of the machine tool, ensure that all major overhaul tasks have been completed and that each repair has met the required qua lity standards. Next, fill all oil reservoirs with lubricant and properly grease all lubrication points. It is crucial to note: Only after completing all necessary preparations in  accordance with the safety operating procedures can you proceed with the no-load tests as outlined by the precision inspection standards specific to the machine tool being used. (2 ) Machine Tool Load Testing. The machine tool load test evaluates whether the machine’s main motion system can achieve the maximum torque and power allowed by the design, as well a s checks if all machine components are functioning properly under these conditions, whether there are any positional changes between parts, and if such changes remain within the pe rmissible limits. Additionally, it ensures that vibrations, noise levels, and temperature rise remain within normal operating ranges. The machine tool load test primarily involves  performing a cutting-load test, where tools and cutting parameters are selected according to specified requirements to machine the surface of test specimens made from a particular  material and in a specific size. During the load test, the spindle speed and feed rate are allowed to deviate by no more than 5% compared to the theoretical values. (3) Machine Too l Working Accuracy Test. The purpose of the machine tool working accuracy test is to determine whether the positional accuracy between the machine’s various components during the m achining process meets the precision requirements of the parts being manufactured. Before the test, its geometric accuracy must be rechecked. The machine tool working accuracy test  involves machining the surface of a specified test piece using cutting tools and appropriate cutting parameters, as outlined in the machine tool accuracy testing standards for wor king precision requirements. The geometric accuracy of the machined workpiece surface must fall within the tolerance range specified by the precision standards of the machine tool  used, and the surface roughness value should not exceed the prescribed standard.",text-EN.txt
81,"1.4.3 General Principles and Requirements for Mechanical Equipment Disassembly Any piece of machine ry is assembled from numerous components. When machinery requires maintenance, it must first be disassembled so that faulty parts can be repaired or replaced. The primary purpose o f dismantling machinery is to facilitate the inspection and repair of its components; in fact, the disassembly process typically accounts for about 20% of the total maintenance wor kload. Therefore, to ensure high-quality repairs, it’s essential to carefully plan ahead and anticipate potential challenges before starting to take apart the equipment. This way,  the dismantling can proceed methodically—following a structured approach that adheres to the following rules and guidelines. Preparations Before Disassembly (1) Selection and Cleanup of the Disassembly Site. Before disassembly, choose an appropriate work area—avoid locations prone to windblown sand or dust. The workspace should be kept free from frequent unauthorized access by unrelated personnel to prevent unnecessary disruptions or accidents. Additionally, ensure that the ground in the work area remains clean, free from dirt, oil, or other contaminants. Prior to entering the disassembly site, all machinery must undergo an external cleaning process to guarantee that the disassembly procedure does not compromise the equipment’s precision. (2) Protective Measures: Before cleaning the exterior of mechanical equipment, electrical devices should be either removed or properly protected to prevent moisture damage. Additionally, parts prone to oxidation and rust should promptly undergo appropriate protective and maintenance measures. (3) Draining the oil before disassembly. Whenever possible, drain the lubricating oil from the machinery while it’s still hot prior to disassembly, ensuring smoother and more efficient removal work. (4) Understand the structure, performance, and operating principles of mechanical equipment. To avoid unnecessary disassembly and ensure the smooth progress of maintenance work, thoroughly assess all aspects of the machinery before dismantling. Familiarize yourself with the structural features of each component, the transmission system, as well as the specific design characteristics and interrelationships of individual parts. Clearly identify their intended functions and how they interact with one another, enabling you to plan the disassembly process logically and select the appropriate tools or equipment for the job. Mechatronics System Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance Case Study Tutorial",text-EN.txt
82,36,text-EN.txt
83,"General Principles for Disassembly (1) Based on the structural characteristics of the mechanical equipment, select a logical disassembly sequence. Typically, the process involves dismantling from the overall unit into subassemblies, then breaking down subassemblies into individual components, and finally separating components into their constituent parts—or alternatively, proceeding from accessories to the main unit and from external elements inward. When disassembling particularly complex components, it’s essential to thoroughly study the assembly drawings and carefully analyze the component’s structure as well as the specific roles its parts play within the assembly. Pay special attention to components that require high precision during assembly. This approach helps prevent confusion, ensures an orderly disassembly process, and ultimately facilitates cleaning, inspection, and identification—laying a solid foundation for effective maintenance work. (2) Rational disassembly. During the maintenance and disassembly of mechanical equipment, adhere to the principle of avoiding unnecessary disassembly while ensuring that components requiring removal are indeed taken apart. (3) Use disassembly tools and equipment correctly. After understanding the steps involved in removing mechanical components, it’s crucial to select and properly apply the appropriate disassembly tools. When dismantling, always opt for specialized or suitably matched tools and equipment whenever possible, avoiding random hammering or forceful techniques to prevent damage or deformation of the parts. For instance, when removing shaft sleeves, rolling bearings, gears, pulleys, and similar components, use pullers or hydraulic presses; and for unscrewing studs or nuts, always prefer wrenches that match their dimensions precisely. Precautions During Disassembly: When performing mechanical equipment maintenance, disassembly should also take into account the subsequent assembly tasks. To ensure a smooth process, keep the following points in mind. (1) Ensure thorough verification or marking of disassembled parts. Mechanical equipment often contains numerous precisely matched components and parts, many of which have been specifically selected or balanced for weight—meaning their assembly positions and orientations must not be altered under any circumstances. Therefore, when dismantling, carefully check parts that already bear original markings. If these markings are unclear, misaligned, or missing altogether, re-mark them exactly as they were originally to ensure proper alignment during reassembly, preventing any confusion or errors. (2) Store parts by category. When storing disassembled parts, follow these principles: Parts belonging to the same type or component should be kept together whenever possible; store items according to their size and precision level; non-interchangeable parts must be stored separately in groups; delicate components that are sensitive to dirt or damage should be removed and stored individually; rubber parts should never be stored alongside oil-bearing components; and ensure that easily lost items are carefully accounted for. Parts such as washers and nuts should be strung together with wire or stored in dedicated containers; all types of studs must be fitted with nuts before being placed in storage. Additionally, parts like steel components, aluminum items, rubber pieces, and leather goods should be stored separately in different containers, categorized by their respective material types. (3) Protect the machined surfaces of removed parts. During disassembly, never damage the machined surfaces of the components being taken apart—doing so could complicate repair work and lead to issues such as air, oil, or water leaks, ultimately resulting in reduced performance of the mechanical equipment. 1.4.4 Disassembly Methods for Commonly Used Components The disassembly of commonly used components should follow general disassembly principles, while also considering their specific characteristics and employing appropriate methods tailored to each component in order to achieve the intended purpose. 1. Disassembly of the Spindle Assembly To prevent reduced assembly accuracy due to improper disassembly, mark the relative positions of bearings, washers, tool housings, and spindles around the circumference during removal. After disassembling, group each bearing along with its corresponding inner and outer washers separately and store them in distinct locations—do not mix them up. Ensure that the workbench and surrounding area at the disassembly site remain clean, and immediately place all removed parts into oil to prevent rusting. When reassembling, be sure to reinstall them according to their original marked orientations.

84,37,text-EN.txt
85,"Disassembly of the Gear Pair To improve the precision of the transmission chain, the gear pair with a transmission ratio of 1 is assembled using an error-compensation method: specifically, the tooth space at the point of maximum radial runout on one external gear is engaged with the tooth space at the point of minimum radial runout on the other gear. To prevent errors introduced during reassembly from remaining unresolved, a mark is made at the mating points of the two gears during disassembly, ensuring that the original precision can be restored during reassembly. Removing Axially Positioned Parts",text-EN.txt
86,"When disassembling shaft components from the gearbox, it is essential to first determine the direction of the shaft's steps, which will dictate the movement direction during removal. Next, remove the shaft caps at both ends, along with any axial positioning parts on the shaft, such as set screws, locknuts, spring washers, and retaining springs. Disassembling Threaded Connections In mechanical equipment, threaded connections are the most widely used method of joining components. They offer advantages such as simple structure, convenient adjustment, and the ability to be repeatedly disassembled and reassembled. While these connections are relatively easy to dismantle, improper handling—such as insufficient attention, incorrect tool selection, or improper dismantling techniques—often leads to damage. Therefore, when removing threaded fasteners, it’s crucial to use the right wrench or screwdriver; always avoid using adjustable wrenches whenever possible. For particularly tough-to-remove threaded joints, first determine the direction of the thread rotation, and never force the connection by twisting randomly or applying excessive leverage with an overly long extension bar. When removing double-ended studs, always use a specialized wrench designed specifically for this purpose. Disassembling Interference-Fit Components When disassembling interference-fit components, select the appropriate removal method, tools, and equipment based on the part's fit dimensions and the size of the interference. Suitable options include pullers, presses, and other specialized tools. Avoid directly striking components with a steel hammer to prevent damage. If no dedicated tools are available, you can use a wooden mallet, copper mallet, or plastic hammer, or alternatively, tap gently using a wooden (or block-shaped) or copper (or block-shaped) rod as a cushion against the steel hammer. Disassembling rolling bearings falls under the category of removing interference-fit components; this process is particularly versatile due to the unique characteristics of these bearings. Therefore, when disassembling, you must not only follow the key points for removing interference-fit components but also take into account their unique characteristics.",text-EN.txt
87,"6. Disassembly of Non-Detachable Fasteners Non-detachable fasteners include welded and riveted components, among others. Welding and riveting are considered permanent connections and are typically not disassembled during maintenance. For dismantling welded components, methods such as sawing, plasma cutting, or first drilling small pilot holes with a drill bit before sawing can be used. Alternatively, oxy-acetylene flame cutting is also effective. As for riveted components, the rivet heads can be removed by chiseling, sawing, or gas cutting, or the rivets themselves can be drilled out using a drill. When performing these operations, care should be taken to avoid damaging the base parts. 1.4.5 Factors to Consider When Repairing Mechanical Part Failures",text-EN.txt
88,"During operation,机电设备 inevitably experience gradual wear, deformation, fracture, corrosion, and other forms of failure in their components. As a result, the equipment's precision,  performance, and productivity decline, potentially leading to malfunctions, accidents, or even complete报废 (scrapping). This underscores the critical need for timely maintenance and  repairs. In restorative maintenance, all measures are aimed at restoring the equipment as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. Effectively eliminate failures to enhance the e quipment's overall utilization rate. Additionally, implementing repair techniques to restore failed components can efficiently achieve this goal. When repairing damage or defects i n mechanical parts, several methods and techniques may be available, but determining the best approach depends on considering the following factors. (1) Consider the compatibility  of the selected repair technique with the part material. When choosing a repair method, the first step should be to determine whether the technique is suitable for the material of  the component being repaired. For instance, manual arc welding is ideal for low-carbon steel, medium-carbon steel, and alloy structural steels—A Case Study Guide for Fault Diagnosi s and Maintenance of Mechanical and Electrical Systems. 38 And stainless steel. Arc surfacing under a flux layer is suitable for low-carbon and medium-carbon steels. Chrome plating  technology works well with carbon structural steels, alloy structural steels, stainless steels, and gray cast iron. Bonded repair methods can firmly join parts made of various met allic and non-metallic materials. Spray coating has a broad applicability—almost any type of metal part, including carbon steel, alloy steel, cast iron components, and the vast maj ority of non-ferrous metal parts, can be coated. However, among metals, only a few non-ferrous materials pose challenges for spraying, such as pure copper; additionally, materials  primarily composed of tungsten or molybdenum are also difficult to coat effectively. (2) Consider the patching layer thicknesses that each repair technique can provide. Since the d egree of wear varies across different parts, the required thickness of the repair layer to compensate for wear will also differ. Therefore, when selecting a repair technique, it’s  important to understand the maximum patching layer thickness achievable by each method.",text-EN.txt
89,"(3) The mechanical properties of the repair layer—such as its strength and hardness—as well  as the bond strength between the repair layer and the component, and the changes in surface strength of the part after repair—are critical indicators for evaluating repair quality  and serve as the basis for selecting the appropriate restoration technique. (4) Consider the operating conditions and requirements of the mechanical parts. When selecting a repair  technique, the working condition of the part should be taken into account. For example, For example, when mechanical parts operate under rolling conditions, the contact surfaces between the two components experience high contact stresses, making repair techniques like chrome plating, spray welding, and overlay welding particularly suitable. In contrast, when mechanical parts function under sliding conditions—where contact stresses are lower—the range of applicable repair technologies becomes much broader. When selecting a repair technique, it’s important to consider whether the mechanical part can still meet operational requirements after restoration. For instance, if the chosen repair method involves high temperatures during application—such as gas welding or electric welding—it may cause annealing of the mechanical component, compromising the original surface’s heat-treated properties and increasing thermal deformation and residual stresses. Techniques like patch welding or buildup welding, which involve high-temperature processes, are therefore best suited only for non-quenched parts, components that undergo post-weld machining or reshaping, or parts requiring subsequent heat treatment after welding. (5) Consider production feasibility. When selecting repair technologies, it’s essential to take into account the practicality of production, aligning the choice with the existing equipment in the company’s repair workshop, the current level of repair expertise, and the efficiency of the repair production management system. (6) Consider cost-effectiveness. When selecting a repair technique, economic factors should be taken into account. The repair cost of the part and the extended service life after repair should be combined to comprehensively evaluate and measure the economic viability of the chosen repair method. When selecting a parts repair process, it’s essential to consider multiple factors comprehensively rather than focusing on just one aspect. On one hand, you must evaluate the technical requirements of the part being repaired; on the other hand, you should assess the specific characteristics of the repair process itself. Additionally, it’s crucial to align the chosen method with your company’s existing repair capabilities and technical expertise. By doing so, you can ensure the process is both technically sound, economically viable, and practically feasible—ultimately leading to the optimal repair solution. 1.4.6 Methods for Repairing Mechanical Parts 1. Repair Dimension Method For certain mating dimensions, wear and other factors can alter the nature of the fit, leading to component failure. In such cases, cutting processes or other methods can be employed to restore the shape accuracy, positional accuracy, surface roughness, and other technical specifications of the worn areas on the primary part. Meanwhile, the complementary, simpler component—whether a new part manufactured to the correct dimensions while maintaining its original fit characteristics, or a repaired version—is produced accordingly. The dimension obtained after this reconditioning process is referred to as the ""repair size."" This approach is economically advantageous and ensures consistent quality since it involves machining directly on the existing component. However, it does reduce the strength and rigidity of the part, and it also necessitates replacing or repairing the mating component, thereby complicating the interchangeability of parts. The repair dimensioning method is primarily used to restore parts with relatively complex structures, while the corresponding complementary part is typically simpler—such as journal bearings, transmission threads, keyways, or sliding guides. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment 39 2. Inlaying Component Method After localized wear of a part, and provided the structure and strength allow, add a component to compensate for the portion removed due to wear or repair, thereby restoring the original dimensions and precision. 3. Local Repair and Replacement Method The localized repair and replacement method restores a part's functionality by addressing worn or damaged areas through techniques such as local repairs, adjustments, repositioning, or partial replacements. 4. Plastic Deformation Method By leveraging the plastic deformation properties of metallic materials, this method allows excess material from non-functional areas of a part to be redistributed onto worn regions under specific external forces, thereby restoring the part’s original shape and dimensions. This approach not only alters the part’s geometry but also modifies its mechanical properties and microstructure. The primary techniques include upsetting, extrusion, expansion, and thermal straightening. When repairing low-carbon steel or non-ferrous metal parts that have not undergone heat treatment, plastic deformation can be performed without heating. For medium- and high-carbon steel parts or alloy steel parts, heating is required during plastic deformation repair. In the case of quenched parts undergoing plastic deformation repair, they must first be subjected to high-temperature tempering or annealing. 5. Metal Riveting Method This method uses specially designed connectors made from metal materials to mechanically and securely rejoin cracked or broken machine components into a single unit. It is characterized by being operated at room temperature, preventing thermal deformation and avoiding stress concentrations. The equipment is simple, and the process is easy to perform. Primarily, this technique is used to repair cracks or fractures in large castings—but it is not recommended for thin-walled castings smaller than 8 mm in thickness. There are strong-buckle bonding, tight-buckle bonding, premium-buckle bonding, and thermal-buckle bonding methods. For the specific processes of each bonding method, please refer to the relevant references. 6. Weld Repair Method The process of welding—where two or more materials (either identical or different) are joined permanently by heating, applying pressure, or combining both methods to achieve atomic-level bonding—is known as welding. At its core, this technique involves repairing damaged parts such as those with cracks or fractures, as well as building up wear-resistant and corrosion-resistant weld layers onto the surfaces of failed components. Its primary purpose is to restore most metal parts that have suffered damage due to wear, breakage, cracking, pitting, or other forms of deterioration. The advantages of the welding repair method include high bonding strength, simple welding equipment, mature technology, no limitations on part size, low cost, high efficiency, and great flexibility. The downside is that, due to the high welding temperature, it can easily cause changes in the microstructure, leading to stress and deformation. Additionally, it’s not suitable for repairing parts that require high precision, are slender, or relatively thin, as these components are prone to defects such as porosity, slag inclusion, and cracking. Welding techniques are primarily applied to metallic base materials, with commonly used methods including arc welding, argon arc welding, CO2 shielded welding, oxy-acetylene welding, laser welding, and more. Non-metallic materials like plastics can also be welded using specialized techniques. Future welding processes will focus on developing new welding methods, equipment, and materials to further enhance welding quality, safety, and reliability. This includes improving existing welding energy sources such as arc, plasma arc, electron beam, and laser technologies. Additionally, advancements in electronics and control technologies will be leveraged to optimize the process performance of arcs, while also enabling the development of reliable, lightweight arc-tracking systems. On the other hand, efforts will be made to elevate the level of welding mechanization and automation. For instance, welders will increasingly feature program-controlled or digitally controlled systems. Specialized automated welding machines capable of handling the entire process—from preparation and welding to quality monitoring—will be developed. Moreover, on automated welding production lines, numerically controlled welding manipulators and robots will be widely adopted and scaled up, boosting overall welding productivity while significantly improving workplace hygiene and safety conditions.

91,"Gas welding A welding method that uses the flame generated by the combustion of a flammable gas mixed with an oxidizing gas as a heat source, melting both the workpiece and the filler material to achieve atomic-level bonding. The primary oxidizing gas is oxygen, while common flammable gases include acetylene, liquefied petroleum gas, and others. Oxygen-acetylene gas welding equipment primarily includes oxygen cylinders, acetylene cylinders (if acetylene is used as the combustible gas), pressure regulators, welding torches, and hoses. Since the gas cylinders used to store these flammable and explosive gases are pressure vessels, this method is one of the most hazardous among all welding techniques. Advantages of gas welding: simple equipment, flexible use; excellent adaptability for welding cast iron and certain non-ferrous metals; and a valuable option when welding is needed in areas with insufficient power supply. Drawbacks of gas welding: lower production efficiency; significant workpiece deformation and a larger heat-affected zone after welding; and greater difficulty in achieving automation. The flame temperature typically ranges from 2,700 to 3,300°C, making it suitable for welding various materials. It is virtually compatible with almost all metallic materials, particularly well-suited for thin sections less than 6 mm thick. Additionally, it excels in welding aluminum, aluminum alloys, copper, and copper alloys. The thickness can be thicker.",text-EN.txt
92,"Shielded Metal Arc Welding Shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), also known as manual arc welding, is an arc welding process in which a welder manually controls the electrode while using the electric arc generated between the electrode and the workpiece to locally heat and melt both the electrode and the base material for joining. It remains the most widely used welding method today. The advantages of this method include: simple equipment that’s easy to maintain, flexible operation, and the ability to weld seams in any spatial position—essentially anywhere the electrode can reach—making it highly versatile across a wide range of applications. The drawbacks are: high requirements for welders, poor working conditions, and low production efficiency. The equipment used in shielded metal arc welding is an arc welder, which has a simple structure and mainly consists of two parts: the arc welding power source and the welding clamp. Welding electrode arc welding equipment should be used with the following precautions. (1) Check that the wiring is correct and ensure the equipment casing is properly grounded. If a welder experiences electric shock, first disconnect the power supply before administering first aid. (2) When operating the power switch, always wear dry gloves and avoid standing directly in front of it to prevent facial burns caused by arc sparks. (3) Welding cables must not be placed near the welding machine or on hot metal welds, and they should also be protected from collisions and abrasion.",text-EN.txt
93,"(4) When stopping work, disconnect the power promptly, and ensure equipment is properly covered when working outdoors. This method can weld a variety of metal materials and accommodate different structural shapes, enabling welding in virtually any position with convenient operation. When selecting welding electrodes, it’s essential to consider the material properties of the workpiece, the working conditions, and the specific structural features. The diameter of the electrode typically varies depending on the thickness of the weldment, as there is a direct relationship between welding current and electrode diameter. During welding, the thickness of each weld pass should generally not exceed 5 mm; however, for thicker workpieces, multi-pass welding may be recommended. 3) Surfacing Welding Using welding techniques, a layer or several layers of material with desired properties are deposited onto the part. This process can restore the part's dimensions and even enhance its performance by improving the surface characteristics of the component. Compared to the entire machine part, the weld overlay is typically very thin, with the primary requirement being high surface wear resistance. Notably, the weld overlay material often differs from the base material, which can lead to challenges in weldability due to these material property differences. Handheld arc surfacing equipment is simple, flexible, and cost-effective, making it particularly suitable for irregularly shaped parts and components that are difficult to access. However, it has low productivity and can be challenging to achieve thin, uniform surfacing layers. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance, p. 41 4) Brazing",text-EN.txt
94,"Use a metal material with a melting point lower than that of the base material as the brazing filler metal, and heat the workpieces—where the filler metal has been placed—to a temp erature above the filler metal's melting point but below the base material's melting point. The method of joining components by using a liquid brazing filler metal that wets the ba se material at its melting point, fills the joint gap, and then diffuses into the base material to form a strong bond is called brazing. Brazing is divided into hard brazing and so ft brazing. Brazing performed using filler metals with melting points above 450°C is commonly referred to as hard brazing, examples include copper brazing and silver brazing; while  brazing conducted with filler metals having melting points below 450°C is typically called soft brazing, such as tin soldering and lead soldering. Brazing has the following charac teristics: ① It requires lower heating temperatures, resulting in minimal changes to the microstructure and mechanical properties of the workpiece. ② The molten braze filler metal fills the gaps between the metals being joined via capillary action, leading to excellent gas-tightness in the weld. ③ The workpiece experiences little deformation, producing smooth and even joints. ④ Can join dissimilar materials. ⑤ Low weld strength. Brazing methods can technically be divided  into two types: soldering iron brazing and flame brazing. (1) Soldering with a soldering iron. The solder and the area to be welded are heated using an electric soldering iron, mak ing it suitable for soft soldering applications where temperatures remain below 300°C—such as with tin-lead or lead-based solders. When soldering thin or small components, a flux i s typically required. The power rating of the soldering iron should be selected based on the type of solder, the material of the workpiece, and the shape and size of the component. (2) Flame brazing. This method uses a flame to heat the braze alloy and the area to be joined, making it suitable for hard brazing applications where temperatures exceed 300°C. It  is particularly ideal for workpieces whose shape, size, or equipment constraints make other brazing methods impractical. Commonly used brazing alloys include copper-zinc, copper-p hosphorus, silver-based, aluminum-based, and zinc-aluminum alloys, enabling the joining of materials such as steel, stainless steel, cemented carbides, cast iron, copper, silver, a luminum, and their respective alloys. Since brazed joints typically exhibit lower strength compared to other welding techniques, brazing is generally recommended for repairing cracks and fractures in components that do not require high structural integrity. Additionally, designing and selecting an appropriate joint configuration is crucial to enhance the overall strength of the assembly. Brazing is especially well-suited for addressing localized defects—such as abrasions or scratches—on low-speed moving parts. 7. Electroplating Repair Technology Electroplating is a process that uses electrolysis to deposit metal onto the surface of a part, forming a metallic coating. The electroplating repair method not only restores the dimensions of worn parts but also enhances their surface quality—particularly improving wear resistance and corrosion resistance. Electroplating repair technology is a widely used technique for restoring component dimensions under low-temperature conditions. Compared to welding repair methods, it avoids the various issues caused by localized high temperatures, while the bond strength between the electroplated layer and the substrate is nearly equivalent to that achieved with welding repairs. This technique leverages the principle of electrolysis: metal ions from the plating solution are reduced into metallic atoms, which then deposit onto the metal surface, forming a repair layer with strong adhesion and precise thickness control. Common applications include chrome plating, low-temperature iron plating, and brush plating. 8. Thermal Spraying and Spray Welding Repair Method Thermal Spray Repair Technology Thermal spraying technology involves using a heat source to melt or partially melt the coating material, which is then sprayed onto a pre-treated su bstrate surface at a controlled speed, forming a coating that bonds firmly to the base material of the workpiece. Utilizing thermal spray repair technology allows for the creation  of a specialized working surface on ordinary materials, enabling them to achieve a variety of functions such as corrosion resistance, wear resistance, friction reduction, high-temp erature protection, antioxidant properties, thermal insulation, electrical insulation, conductivity, and even microwave radiation shielding. Thermal spray technology is a key compo nent of surface processing techniques, accounting for approximately one-third of all surface engineering technologies. Based on the type of heat source used to heat the spraying ma terial, thermal spraying can be categorized into: ① Flame-based methods, including flame spraying, detonation spraying, and supersonic spraying; ② Arc-based methods, comprising arc spraying and plasma spraying; ③ Electrothermal methods, such as electro-explosive spraying, induction heating spraying, and capacitive discharge spraying; ④ Laser-based methods, specifically laser spraying. Case Study Tutorial on Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Mechatronic Systems",text-EN.txt
95,"42 If classified by spraying or thermal spraying materials, they can be divided into wire-shaped and  powder-form types. Thermal spray repair technology offers numerous advantages, as detailed below. (1) The equipment is lightweight and can be installed on-site.",text-EN.txt
96,"(2) The process is  flexible, requires few operational steps, allows for quick repairs, and reduces machining time. (3) Highly adaptable, generally unrestricted by workpiece size or site conditions. ( 4) Coating thickness can be controlled. (5) Apart from spray welding, the base material is heated to a lower temperature, resulting in minimal workpiece deformation and only slight  changes in microstructure and mechanical properties. (6) Components made from various substrate materials can be used to prepare a wide range of protective and functional coatings  on nearly all solid material surfaces. However, it’s important to remember that spray painting is an extremely hazardous task. Operators must always keep the following warnings in  mind: High-speed, high-temperature spray jets can cause injury to both people and equipment; spray dust is harmful to health—so ensure proper dust control and adequate ventilation ; loud spray noise may damage hearing—always wear ear protection; and radiation from the spray arc can harm your eyesight—make sure to wear safety goggles. Spray Welding Repair Technology If the thermal spray coating is further heated until both the coating and the substrate surface reach a molten state, allowing them to fuse together through metallurgical bonding and forming a robust working layer, this technique is known as spray welding repair technology. The materials used in spray welding can include various metals, alloys, or even non-metals, while the substrate material itself can also be made from a wide range of metals, alloys, or non-metals. The thickness of the spray-welded coating typically ranges from 0.5 mm to several millimeters, and the resulting coating structure is porous, which helps retain oil, leading to excellent lubrication and wear resistance. The spray welding process itself is straightforward. Single, short repair cycles, high productivity, and low costs. The spray welding repair technique can effectively enhance and improve the performance of part surfaces, such as oxidation resistance, electrical conductivity, insulation properties, and thermal insulation. However, the bond strength of the sprayed coating is relatively low, so caution should be exercised during application. Spray welding repair can restore the dimensions of worn components, such as machine tool spindles, crankshafts, camshaft journals, motor rotor shafts, machine tool guides, and slides. It can also be used to repair defects in castings, like sand holes and porosity. Additionally, applying a wear-resistant material—such as phosphor bronze or aluminum bronze—to areas requiring enhanced durability can significantly improve the component's resistance to wear. Meanwhile, spraying protective coatings onto specific areas can boost the part's corrosion resistance and other performance characteristics. Bonding and Coating Repair Techniques The method of joining parts made of the same or different materials into a single unit using adhesives, or of repairing worn or damaged compon ents, is known as bonding and repair bonding. Bonding can be used to fix broken parts, replacing screw connections when installing guide rail plates. It can also involve applying a dhesive to the worn areas of components—such as shafts or holes—followed by machining to restore their dimensions and geometric accuracy. Additionally, adhesives are employed to se al the mating surfaces between housings and lids, as well as pipe joints, ensuring both a tight seal and secure locking of threaded connections. Furthermore, adhesives can fill def ects like sand holes, air pockets, and porosity in castings, effectively preventing leaks and other issues. The bonding process has several advantages: First, it offers strong adhe sive strength and can bond a wide range of materials—everything from various metals to non-metallic substances. First, it provides strong adhesion and can bond dissimilar materials  together. Second, the process operates at relatively low temperatures, preventing thermal deformation of the bonded materials. Third, after bonding, the integrity and surface fini sh of the original components remain intact, with no stress concentrations formed. Additionally, the adhesive joint exhibits excellent chemical stability, insulation properties, an d sealing performance. Finally, the bonding process is simple, cost-effective, and allows for quick repair times. The drawback of the bonding process is that it lacks high-temperat ure resistance—organic adhesives typically can only withstand long-term operation up to 150°C. Inorganic adhesives can withstand high temperatures of up to 700°C; however, they exh ibit poor impact resistance and aging performance. Compared to welding, their bonding strength is relatively low. Nowadays, plastic components are increasingly used in engineering  applications. Plastics are broadly categorized into two types: thermoplastics and thermosets. For bonding thermoplastic parts, both hot-melt adhesive bonding and solvent-based adhe sive bonding methods can be employed. The specific procedures are outlined below. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance for Mechanical and Electrical Equipment 43 (1) Hot-melt bonding method. The surfaces to be bonded are heated and melted using electric heat, hot air, or frictional heat, then pressed together under sufficient pressure u ntil they cool and solidify. For most thermoplastic materials, heating the surface to 150–230°C is sufficient for bonding. (2) Solvent bonding method. Apply the appropriate solvent  to the bonding area, allow it to soften the plastic, and then bring the surfaces together while applying pressure. Force ensures strong adhesion once the solvent has evaporated, s uch as when polyethylene dissolves in xylene. If the solvent is chosen appropriately, the results are even better—however, thermosetting plastics remain insoluble in the solvent. Surface Enhancement Technologies Surface enhancement technology refers to a process that modifies the microstructure and properties of a part's surface, making them distinct from those of the base material. This technique can significantly improve the surface’s hardness, strength, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance. Specifically, it includes several methods such as surface mechanical strengthening, surface heat treatment strengthening, chemical heat treatment strengthening, laser surface treatment, and electrical discharge machining-based surface enhancement. Surface Mechanical Strengthening Surface mechanical strengthening involves inducing compressive deformation in the metal surface of a part through methods such as shot peening, roll forming, and internal extrusion, creating a hardened layer measuring 0.3 to 1.5 mm in thickness on the surface. Shot peening involves blasting high-velocity projectiles onto a component's surface, inducing intense plastic deformation in the metal material and creating a cold-worked layer with elevated residual stresses—known as the shot-peened layer. Shot peening enhances a material's resistance to fatigue fracture, preventing fatigue failure, plastic deformation, and brittle fracture while extending its fatigue life. It is suitable for use in a wide range of industries, including machinery, aerospace, marine applications, petroleum, mining, railways, transportation, heavy machinery, and military equipment. Rolling enhancement involves using a diamond or other type of rolling head to apply a specific rolling force onto the surface of a part. A method that induces hardening of the rolled surface through strain-induced strengthening, thereby enhancing the mechanical properties of the component's surface. Surface Heat Treatment Strengthening and Chemical Heat Treatment Strengthening (1) Surface heat treatment strengthening. Surface heat treatment is a metal heat treatment process that involves heating only the surface layer of a workpiece to alter its mechanical properties. To heat only the surface of the workpiece without allowing excessive heat to penetrate into its interior, the heat source used must have a high energy density—meaning it delivers significant thermal energy over a small area of the workpiece, enabling the surface or specific regions to reach extremely high temperatures in a short or even instantaneous time. The main methods of surface heat treatment include flame quenching and induction heating, while common heat sources include flames such as oxy-acetylene or oxy-propane, as well as induced currents, lasers, and electron beams. (2) Surface chemical heat treatment strengthening. Surface chemical heat treatment is a metal heat treatment process that alters the chemical composition, microstructure, and properties of a workpiece's surface layer. Unlike surface heat treatment, which primarily modifies the material's surface properties through temperature changes, surface chemical heat treatment specifically targets the chemical composition of the surface layer. Chemical heat treatment involves heating a workpiece in a medium containing carbon, nitrogen, or other alloying elements—such as gas, liquid, or solid—and holding it at that temperature for an extended period. This process allows elements like carbon, nitrogen, boron, and chromium to diffuse into the surface of the workpiece. After diffusion, additional heat treatment processes, such as quenching and tempering, may be carried out as needed. The main methods of chemical heat treatment include carburizing, nitriding, and metal impregnation. 3) Laser Surface Treatment Heating is achieved using a laser beam, which rapidly melts a thin layer of the workpiece surface to a specific depth. Simultaneously, alloy elements are applied to the workpiece surface via methods such as vacuum evaporation, electroplating, or ion implantation. Under laser irradiation, these elements fully fuse with the base metal, and after solidification, a specially engineered alloy layer—ranging from 10 to 1,000 micrometers thick—is formed on the mold surface, exhibiting unique properties. The cooling rate during this process is equivalent to… Quenching with Rapid Cooling: A Case Study Tutorial on Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Mechatronic Systems",text-EN.txt

99,"1.5.1 The Significance of Equipment Management Strengthening equipment management and ensuring proper maintenance will keep machinery consistently in excellent condition, thereby extending its lifespan. This not only plays a critical role in boosting production volume and variety, enhancing labor productivity, reducing consumption, lowering costs, and safeguarding worker safety—but also significantly contributes to upgrading the company’s overall production technology, accelerating industrial growth, and protecting productive capacity. Equipment management is an extremely important task—only by effectively managing equipment can organizations achieve optimal economic results with minimal human, financial, and material resources. This, in turn, allows for the full realization of equipment potential, enabling businesses to better meet production goals. Especially in modern manufacturing, prioritizing sound equipment management is a fundamental principle that must be followed. Equipment maintenance management is an important component of enterprise management. Its primary tasks include: maximizing Effectively collecting and utilizing equipment information resources allows for the strategic management of manpower, materials, funds, equipment, and technology within the maintenance system, ensuring that maintenance operations achieve optimal quality and maximum efficiency. The key components of maintenance management include maintenance information management, maintenance planning, maintenance technology, process and quality control, spare parts management, and maintenance economic management. In modern enterprises, management is inseparable from technology, while the effective application of engineering technologies relies on sound management practices. Equipment engineering technicians, who are well-versed in equipment maintenance management principles and methods, should seamlessly integrate technical expertise with managerial skills. To this end, this section will outline the key aspects, methodologies, and practical applications of equipment maintenance management. 1.5.2 Information Management for Equipment Maintenance In corporate equipment maintenance activities, it is often necessary to make various technical and economic decisions, and the basis for these decisions is information. Breath. Without a systematic and reliable information system, effective management becomes difficult to implement. Therefore, the task of equipment maintenance information management is to establish a comprehensive information system that collects, stores, and organizes all types of equipment-related data, while also enabling data processing, output, and feedback—ultimately supporting informed economic and technical decision-making for equipment management. 1. Classification of Equipment Maintenance Information Equipment maintenance information can be complex, but it can generally be categorized using the following methods. 1) Categorized by equipment in the early versus later stages This classification method divides equipment information into two major systems—early-stage and later-stage—and further breaks them down into numerous subsystems. Within these subsystems, various types of equipment are grouped, ultimately leading to a detailed breakdown for each individual device. The approach is straightforward and clear, making it easy to process, organize, and access the information. 2) Categorized by equipment management objectives and performance indicators",text-EN.txt
100,"Enterprise authorities, investors, and business operators all need to understand and monitor key indicators, such as output value per ten thousand yuan. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance 45 Repair costs, equipment integrity rate, maintenance expenses per 10,000 yuan of equipment value, and more. To facilitate statistical analysis, equipment information can be categorized into five main types: investment planning data, asset and spare parts information, technical condition data, maintenance schedule details, and personnel information. Each category can further be broken down into numerous sub-items and specific evaluation metrics, making it easier to conduct comprehensive classification-based analysis. 3) Categorized from a maintenance perspective Equipment information can be categorized into equipment status information, equipment maintenance information, equipment failure or accident information, repair work information, repair material information, repair personnel information, repair cost information, and related information, among others. 2. Functions of the Computer Repair Information System In modern enterprises, a computer maintenance information system can either serve as a subsystem within the company's management system or operate as an independent system altogether. The functionality of a computer maintenance information system is closely tied to the configuration of both the hardware and software components of computers. Currently, several versatile equipment management software solutions have already been integrated into the system software. The computer maintenance information system offers the following key functions in equipment repair and management: 1) Process Control Function The process control function can be used to monitor equipment operating conditions and detect key performance parameters such as vibration, noise, ultrasound, temperature rise, cooling status, lubrication condition, and environmental factors, providing critical information to guide maintenance activities. 2) Engineering Design and Calculation Functionality The engineering design and calculation function enables mechanical analysis and computations for various equipment and maintenance tooling, as well as supports computer-aided design and drafting, along with diverse optimization processes. 3) Information Processing Function The information processing function handles various types of data in maintenance management, covering the following 5 aspects: (1) Equipment Ledger Management. Store the original data and documentation for all company equipment in a computer system, allowing you to generate workshop equipment ledgers and equipment lists by model—in various formats—as needed. (2) Equipment classification, sorting, querying, and retrieval. Categorize and sort equipment supply information available in the market, storing it in the system to provide insights when companies update or add new equipment. (3) Equipment Maintenance Planning Management. When determining equipment maintenance plans, you can refer to equipment records, maintenance information, and diagnostic data stored in the computer system, and, based on actual conditions, use the computer to develop annual, quarterly, and monthly equipment maintenance schedules. (4) Maintenance Spare Parts Management. By entering the enterprise equipment maintenance spare parts’ demand information, inventory details, and inbound/outbound records into the computer system, users can instantly access real-time inventory status and generate statistical reports. Additionally, an alert notification can be automatically triggered when the current stock level drops below the predefined warning threshold. (5) Other functions. The computer system can also provide service functionalities to the maintenance system, including personnel management, financial management, and technical and process management. 1.5.3 Equipment Maintenance Plan Management The enterprise's equipment management department conducts planned, appropriately scaled maintenance on its equipment. When carrying out specific maintenance tasks, it’s also essential to organize resources effectively to ensure the progress, quality, and efficiency of the repairs. This planning and organizational process is known as Maintenance Planning Management. It comprises two key components: first, a macro-level maintenance plan (including annual, quarterly, and monthly schedules); and second, a detailed tutorial on micro-level mechanical and electrical system fault diagnosis and repair cases. 46 The work plan refers to a specific operational process, such as a major overhaul schedule for a machine, and is characterized by its closer relationship to process technology. Standard Workload for Equipment Maintenance The equipment maintenance work quotas serve as the basis for developing equipment maintenance plans and organizing repair operations. Accurately establishing these maintenance quotas enhances the scientific rigor and predictive capability of maintenance planning, facilitates thorough preparation before repairs begin, and ensures that maintenance activities are conducted in a more cost-effective and rational manner. Before drafting mechanical and electrical equipment maintenance plans, it is essential to first define various maintenance quotas. The main equipment maintenance quotas include: equipment maintenance complexity factor, maintenance labor-hour quota, maintenance downtime quota, maintenance cycle and interval period, and maintenance cost quota. 1) Equipment Maintenance Complexity Factor The equipment maintenance complexity factor, also known as the maintenance complexity unit or simply the maintenance unit, is a hypothetical measure used to assess the intricacy of equipment repair tasks, determine the associated workload, and establish standard benchmarks for various metrics. This assumed unit represents the maintenance effort required for a specific type of machinery, with its value determined by factors such as the equipment's structural design, dimensions, size, and precision levels. In general, the more complex the equipment's structure, the larger its physical dimensions, and the higher the machining accuracy demanded, the greater its maintenance complexity factor will be. For instance, in metal-cutting machine tools, the C620 lathe—typically featuring a maximum workpiece diameter of 400 mm and a maximum workpiece length of 1,000 mm—is often used as the benchmark machine. Its maintenance complexity factor is standardized at 10. As for electrical equipment, the focus shifts to… A protected cage-type synchronous motor with a rated power of 0.6 kW is standard equipment, and its maintenance complexity factor is specified as 1. For other machinery and equipment, the maintenance complexity factor can be determined by comparing their structure, size, precision, and other characteristics to those of the standard unit. Once a labor quota for one maintenance unit (represented by ""R"") has been established, the maintenance workload for any other type of machine can be calculated based on this unit. Additionally, maintenance downtime quotas and cost estimates can also be derived using the maintenance unit as a benchmark. The enterprise's supervisory authority has determined the maintenance complexity factors for various types of equipment and machine tools (establishing separate complexity factors for mechanical and electrical systems), and formulated these into company standards for use during equipment maintenance activities.",text-EN.txt
101,"2) Standardized Maintenance Labor Quotas The maintenance labor quota refers to the amount of labor time required by a company to complete various repair tasks for machinery and equipment, typically expressed as the number of work hours needed for a single repair complexity factor. For example, the labor quota for a major overhaul of a machine tool with one repair complexity factor includes 40 hours for fitters, 20 hours for machining operations, and 4 hours for other trades, totaling 64 hours. 3) Standardized Maintenance Downtime Rates The standard maintenance downtime refers to the time taken from when equipment is handed over for repair until the repair is completed and accepted. This duration is determined based on the maintenance complexity factor. Generally speaking, the higher the maintenance complexity factor, the more intricate the equipment's structure—and most of these devices are critical, key components in production that significantly impact operational efficiency. Therefore, it is essential to minimize maintenance downtime as much as possible to ensure smooth production processes. 4) Maintenance Cycle and Maintenance Interval The maintenance cycle is the operating time of machinery and equipment between two consecutive overhauls. For new equipment, it refers to the period from the start of production until the first major overhaul. The maintenance cycle is determined comprehensively based on factors such as the equipment’s structural and process characteristics, the type of production and nature of work, the level of maintenance and repair practices, the materials being processed, and the allowable wear limits of equipment components. The maintenance interval is the operating time of machinery and equipment between two consecutive maintenance sessions. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance 47 The inspection interval is the operating time of machinery and equipment between two consecutive inspections—or between an inspection and the subsequent maintenance. 5) Standardized Repair Costs The maintenance cost quota refers to the prescribed expense standard for completing machinery and equipment repairs—it serves as a financial benchmark for evaluating maintenance work. Companies should prioritize the economic efficiency of maintenance efforts and continuously strive to reduce the maintenance cost quota. 2. Maintenance Plan Development",text-EN.txt
102,"1) Categories of Equipment Maintenance Plans The time-phased plans include: ① The annual maintenance plan, which encompasses all major, medium, and minor repair schedules for the enterprise throughout the year, as well as regular equipment maintenance and upgrade/installation plans. This plan should be completed by the end of the previous year. ② The quarterly maintenance plan, derived from the annual plan, further breaks down the yearly objectives into more detailed tasks. It also allows for timely adjustments and additions to project timelines and sequences based on actual conditions, typically finalized during the last month of the preceding quarter. ③ The monthly maintenance plan, which is even more specific and meticulous than the quarterly plan, serves as the operational blueprint for executing maintenance activities. Critical tasks such as routine upkeep, periodic inspections, and scheduled diagnostics must all be incorporated into the monthly plan. Additionally, any issues identified during the previous month’s routine checks will be addressed by scheduling minor repairs this month. Plans categorized by maintenance type usually consist of the annual major overhaul plan and the annual equipment preventive maintenance schedule. The budget is primarily intended for corporate finance departments to prepare funds for major repairs and control major repair expenses. Some companies also prepare budgets for itemized repairs and minor maintenance tasks. Detailed schedule for maintenance, preventive testing, and regular precision adjustments.",text-EN.txt

104,"(1) Basis for preparing the maintenance plan. ① The technical condition of equipment refers to its actual state in terms of technical performance, load capacity, transmission mecha nisms, and operational safety. Key indicators reflecting the quality of a company’s equipment—including equipment integrity rate, failure downtime rate, and the extent to which equ ipment impacts balanced production—provide a clear picture of the overall technical condition. Information on equipment’s technical status is primarily gathered through comprehensi ve surveys and assessments of equipment conditions, as well as from original documentation. Typically, companies conduct equipment surveys during the third quarter of each year, wi th the main objective of identifying existing issues, proposing corrective measures, and completing the Equipment Technical Condition Survey Form, which then serves as the foundati on for developing maintenance plans. Original records include daily inspections, routine checks, condition-monitoring logs, repair histories, and other primary documents, along wit h comprehensive analytical data. Equipment showing signs of deteriorating technical conditions and requiring maintenance should be included as items in the annual maintenance plan  application. ② Requirements for equipment based on production processes and product quality.

108,"⑤ Propose solutions to address the contradictions that have emerged in the above 4 steps. (4) Typically, the equipment maintenance plan for the following year is  prepared in September each year. The preparation process follows these 4 steps: ① Gather information. Before drafting the plan, thorough data collection and analysis must be conducted. This primarily involves two key areas: first, technical condition data of  the equipment, such as original documentation, equipment inspection forms, product process requirements, and quality-related information, to determine the appropriate maintenance c ategory; and second, the annual production schedule, equipment maintenance quotas, relevant technical specifications for the equipment, and current inventory levels of spare parts. ② Prepare the draft. When drafting, fully consider how the annual production plan impacts equipment requirements, ensuring that maintenance schedules are aligned with production p lans. This will help prevent both under-maintenance and over-maintenance of equipment. Before formally submitting the draft annual maintenance plan, the equipment management depart ment, under the leadership of the chief plant manager, should organize a comprehensive technical and economic analysis and evaluation involving departments such as process engineer ing, technology, operations, and production—aiming to achieve well-balanced, rational objectives. ③ Balanced Approval. After the draft plan is completed, it is distributed to the p roduction, planning, engineering, technical, finance, and user departments for discussion. Participants are invited to propose modifications, such as adding or removing items, adju sting maintenance downtime durations, setting machine-off delivery dates, and revising maintenance categories. Once these inputs are comprehensively evaluated and balanced, the fin al maintenance plan is formally prepared and submitted to senior management for approval. The maintenance plan must be filled out on the prescribed form, including details such as:  the equipment’s basic information (user department, asset number, name, and model), the repair complexity factor, the type or scope of the repair work, time quotas, downtime durat ion, planned schedule, and the responsible maintenance contractor. Additionally, a plan description should be prepared, highlighting key priorities, identifying potential weak link s, and outlining critical issues that need attention. Finally, preliminary measures and recommendations should be proposed to address these crucial challenges effectively. ④ Issue  for execution. Before December each year, the enterprise's production planning department will issue the equipment maintenance plan for the following year, serving as the basis for  the company's operations. It serves as an important component for evaluating production and business plans.",text-EN.txt
109,"3. Maintenance Work Plan Management When carrying out any specific equi pment maintenance task, it is essential to develop a work plan. Utilizing network planning techniques to create these work plans optimizes job process management, ensures efficient  use of all resources, shortens the repair timeline, and minimizes downtime-related losses. This approach is particularly suitable for major overhauls of large, complex equipment,  as well as for planning project-based repairs and installation/adjustment projects involving such machinery. 4. Implementation of the Equipment Maintenance Plan Once the equipment  maintenance plan is finalized, it must be strictly implemented to ensure its successful execution and strive to minimize downtime. Regular inspections of the plan's implementation  are essential—these checks not only help maintain schedule adherence but also guarantee the quality of the repairs. After the maintenance work is completed, a joint inspection by r elevant departments is mandatory. Each aspect of the equipment—such as precision and performance—must be thoroughly examined and verified against the established quality standards.  Only when all criteria meet the repair quality benchmarks can we confidently ensure that production resumes smoothly. To minimize maintenance downtime and ensure the successful im plementation of the plan, advanced maintenance organization methods can be employed depending on the specific situation. These methods primarily include the following three approac hes: Chapter 1—Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance",text-EN.txt
110,49,text-EN.txt
111,"Component Repair Method By treating equipment components as the primary focus of maintenance—replacing entire components during repairs—the process allows for disassembly, reassembly of parts, and even manufacturing tasks to be carried out after the component has been replaced. This approach significantly reduces downtime during maintenance. However, the component-based repair method requires maintaining a certain inventory of spare parts, which ties up some working capital. For companies that own large numbers of similar equipment, this method is particularly well-suited. Component Repair Method Some machinery and equipment experience heavy production loads, making it difficult to schedule ample time for major overhauls. In such cases, the sectional maintenance method can be employed. This approach involves repairing different components of the equipment at separate times—rather than all at once—by systematically and sequentially addressing each independent part of the machine, focusing on just one section at a time. The key advantage of sectional maintenance is that it allows organizations to take advantage of holidays Repairs are carried out during non-production hours to maximize machine uptime and improve equipment utilization. The sectional repair method is suitable for machinery with structurally independent components, as well as equipment requiring lengthy maintenance periods—such as modular machine tools and heavy-duty transportation equipment. 3) Synchronized Maintenance Method The synchronized maintenance method involves arranging several pieces of equipment, which are interconnected in the production process, to undergo maintenance simultaneously, thereby achieving synchronized upkeep and minimizing downtime associated with decentralized repairs. This approach is commonly applied to equipment on assembly lines, particularly to main units, auxiliary machines, and supporting systems within integrated production lines. The implementation of the single-equipment maintenance plan involves the following steps: (1) Delivery for Repair. The equipment user unit shall deliver the equipment to the repair unit on the date specified in the maintenance plan. During the handover, a thorough inspection and verification must be conducted, and the ""Equipment Handover Form"" should be completed in duplicate, with each party retaining one copy. After the equipment completion and acceptance, both parties shall count the equipment as per the ""Equipment Handover Form,"" along with the accompanying accessories and specialized tools that were transferred together. (2) Maintenance and Construction. During the maintenance process, the following key steps should generally be carefully managed: ① Dismantling Inspection: After the equipment is disassembled, the lead technician and maintenance workers will promptly inspect the components for wear and failure. Special attention should be paid to identifying any issues that were either undetected or unforeseen prior to the repair process. Additionally, the following technical documents and drawings should be issued as soon as possible: a detailed list of parts to be repaired or replaced, based on inspection findings; an updated and supplemented bill of materials; revised and supplementary sections of the maintenance technical specification sheet; and temporary manufacturing drawings for any custom-made components. Planning and scheduling personnel, together with the maintenance team leader, will revise and adjust the maintenance work plan based on the actual situation, then post it at the construction site so that all involved personnel can stay informed about the project progress. ② Production scheduling. The maintenance team leader must daily monitor the actual progress of repair work on each component and mark it clearly with a red line on the work schedule. If a task is found to be delayed, the team leader can reallocate resources based on the time buffers indicated in the network plan to get the project back on track. Planning and scheduling personnel should daily review the progress of work plans, paying close attention to the pace of tasks on critical paths. They should collaborate with technicians, workers, and team leaders to promptly address any issues arising during construction. Additionally, emphasis should be placed on ensuring smooth coordination among different trades to prevent idle time, material shortages, and delays that could impact project timelines. ③ Process Quality Inspection: After maintenance personnel complete each process and pass their own self-inspection, the work must be inspected by a quality control inspector. Only after confirmation of compliance can it proceed to the next process. For critical processes that pass inspection, a label should be affixed. ④ Progress in manufacturing temporary components. The progress of manufacturing temporary parts often becomes the primary factor delaying repair work. To address this, meticulously schedule processing steps for each critical component and implement measures to ensure they remain ready for use without delay.

113,"(3) Completion and Acceptance. After the major equipment overhaul is completed and successfully tested by the maintenance unit, the equipment undergoes a formal completion and acceptance process. The acceptance is led by a representative from the equipment management department, who, along with representatives from quality control and the user department, verifies that all repair tasks specified in the repair work order have been fully accomplished and that the equipment meets both quality standards and technical requirements. Once this is confirmed, all parties involved sign the ""Equipment Repair Completion Report"" to officially approve the work. If discrepancies arise between the two parties during the handover process, the matter should be referred to the Chief Mechanical Engineer for final resolution. 1.5.4 Maintenance Techniques, Processes, and Quality Management",text-EN.txt
114,Equipment maintenance technology and process management refer to the scientific administration of all technical and operational activities involved in the maintenance system and the repair process. Equipment maintenance quality management involves a series of managerial practices aimed at ensuring the high quality of equipment repairs. These three areas of management play a crucial role in successfully completing equipment maintenance tasks. Management of Basic Maintenance Technical Tasks,text-EN.txt
115,"Management of Maintenance Technical Documentation Equipment maintenance technical documentation primarily comes from the technical materials provided as part of the equipment purchase; materials acquired during use from equipment manufacturers, relevant organizations, scientific bookstores, and more; as well as documents designed, surveyed, and compiled in-house. Management is as described below. (1) Specification standards, including relevant international standards, national standards, departmentally issued standards, as well as applicable laws and regulations. (2) Drawing materials, including instruction manuals for mechanical power equipment within the company, partial equipment manufacturing drawings, maintenance and assembly diagrams, spare parts catalogues, and related technical documentation. (3) Layout Diagram of Power Station Equipment and Power Pipeline Network Diagram. (4) Process documentation, including maintenance procedures, parts repair processes, critical component manufacturing techniques, and drawings for specialized tools and fixtures, etc. (5) Maintenance Quality Standards and Equipment Testing Procedures. (6) General technical documents, including equipment manuals, research reports, experimental data, calculation notes, cost analyses, claim reports, standard technical materials, patent documents, and relevant literature, among others. (7) Samples and books, including domestic and international samples, books, periodicals, electronic publications, CDs, floppy disks, photographs, and slides, among others. 2) Management Program Maintenance technical documentation is primarily intended for use within the equipment management system and should generally be managed centrally in a dedicated documentation room. The management process should encompass the entire lifecycle of the materials—covering collection, organization, evaluation, classification, numbering, reproduction (such as drafting), storage, retrieval, and distribution. Effective management of technical documentation requires prioritization: key equipment manuals, along with relevant assembly drawings, electrical schematics, and other critical documents, should be clearly marked for enhanced oversight. Importantly, these priority documents are typically not available for external loan. To facilitate compilation and retrieval, it is necessary to establish a coded indexing system for the data and implement computer-based management. The equipment maintenance manual serves as a comprehensive collection of specialized technical documentation for equipment repair, providing maintenance personnel with essential resources for troubleshooting, diagnosing faults, developing repair strategies, and even manufacturing spare parts when needed. The equipment maintenance manuals are compiled separately for each equipment model, and the manuals should include the following content. (1) Features and Feature Diagrams. The features and feature diagrams include an outline diagram, lifting diagram, installation foundation drawing, and Chapter 1—Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance. 51",text-EN.txt
116,"Transmission system diagram, hydraulic system diagram, electrical systems and wiring diagrams, rolling bearing location maps, and lubrication system diagrams, among others. (2) Assembly drawings. Manufacturers typically do not provide complete assembly drawings for components, subassemblies, and the finished machine. Whenever possible, you should gather these drawings or, during equipment maintenance, create detailed sketches of critical components or the entire machine. (3) Spare parts, wear-and-tear component drawings and bills of materials, along with a list of purchased components. (4) Other content. For power equipment, as-built drawings, piping or wiring network diagrams, and similar documents should also be provided. 3) Maintenance Technical Preparation Work Technical preparation work before equipment maintenance is also an important foundational task, primarily involving a pre-maintenance technical condition assessment and the preparation of maintenance-related technical documents. 2. Standardization of Maintenance Procedures To ensure repair quality, enhance repair efficiency, and prevent resource waste, it is necessary to standardize the various procedural practices involved in the repair process. 1) Maintenance Procedures (1) Typical maintenance procedures. A typical maintenance procedure refers to the repair process developed for common wear-and-tear scenarios affecting parts of a specific equipment type and structural design—parts that are identical across such equipment. While these procedures offer broad guidance, they often lack specificity when applied to a particular piece of equipment. (2) Dedicated maintenance procedures. Dedicated maintenance procedures refer to processes specifically developed by a company for a particular model of equipment, tailored to address its actual wear-and-tear conditions. Moreover, the maintenance procedure prepared for a specific repair of this equipment still holds significant reference value for future repairs and should be adjusted and updated as needed, based on actual wear conditions and technological advancements.",text-EN.txt
117,"2) Key Points for Process Specification Work (1) Disassembly process. When repairing mechanical equipment, the first step is to partially disassemble and take it apart. However, each time a machine is disassembled, its perfor mance and precision inevitably suffer some degree of damage. Improper disassembly of precision equipment can even lead to complete报废 of the device. Therefore, it is crucial to appr oach this process with utmost care and expertise. Key and precision equipment should have dismantling process specifications developed. The general principles and precautions for d isassembly will be introduced in Chapter 2 and can serve as a reference when developing the disassembly process. Additionally, please keep the following points in mind. ① Safety co mes first during disassembly. Before starting, ensure the power supply is disconnected, remove any hazardous materials—such as toxic or flammable substances—from both inside and ou tside the machinery and equipment, set up reliable supports, and select appropriate lifting equipment and tools. ② Disassembly for service and maintenance. Do not disassemble compo nents that are unnecessary or prohibited. For parts with tight fits, establish a proper disassembly method and use appropriate tools to avoid damaging critical surfaces. ③ Disassem bly serves assembly. When the machine structure is complex and the drawing documentation is incomplete, disassemble while simultaneously documenting details and sketching prelimina ry diagrams, ultimately compiling a complete assembly drawing. (2) Parts cleaning process. The cleaning process should include details such as the cleaning method, cleaning procedu re, type or formulation of the cleaning agent, cleaning parameters, cleaning quality, and important precautions during cleaning. (3) Repair Processes for Typical Components. In equ ipment maintenance, certain critical parts—such as machine beds, housings, worktables, and large rotating components—often require restoration. To ensure effective repairs and enha nce overall efficiency, it’s essential to select the appropriate repair solution and develop a detailed maintenance process procedure. These procedures are typically documented in  the form of process cards, which provide more specifics than standard manufacturing process cards yet remain simpler than operation-specific cards. A typical maintenance process ca rd usually includes the following information: ① Part name, drawing number, material and properties, part defect indication diagram, and explanations regarding the defects.",text-EN.txt
118,"② Repai r procedures and work steps, including operational guidelines for each step and the corresponding technical requirements to be achieved. A Tutorial on Diagnostics and Maintenance C ases for Mechatronic Systems 52 ③ Process specification requirements during the repair process. ④ Equipment, fixtures, tools, measuring instruments, and other materials used during  the repair process, as well as the inspection procedures following the repair. Detailed and standardized repair processes and adjustment methods should also be established for the  maintenance of critical, precision components, ensuring the quality of repairs. (4) Repair and Assembly Processes. The main contents of the repair and assembly process specificati ons include preparation for repair and assembly, the sequence for assembling components during repair and overall assembly, repair and assembly methods, analysis of repair dimensio n chains, adjustment and compensation techniques for ensuring repair assembly accuracy, as well as inspection methods. Additionally, the procedures cover inspection and test runs a fter repair and assembly. (5) Employ advanced maintenance techniques. In equipment repair, actively learn cutting-edge maintenance processes and technologies from both domestic and  international sources. Based on the actual conditions of your enterprise, adopt relatively mature new processes and materials to gradually replace outdated techniques. Develop systems and measures for learning, researching, testing, and implementing advanced maintenance technologies, continuously enhancing the company's equipment repair expertise and process capabilities. 3. Quality Management of Equipment Maintenance To ensure the quality of equipment maintenance, quality management should be implemented for equipment repairs. 1) The content of equipment maintenance and quality management (1) Establish quality standards for equipment maintenance. (2) Develop equipment maintenance procedures. (3) Inspection and evaluation of equipment maintenance quality. (4) Strengt hen quality management during the maintenance process. Establish quality control points for critical procedures and encourage participation in grassroots quality management team ac tivities, ensuring thorough implementation of the maintenance process plan. (5) Conduct post-repair customer service and quality feedback activities. (6) Strengthen technical train ing efforts to enhance both technical and managerial skills. 2) Inspection of Equipment Repair Quality Enterprises should establish organizations and assign personnel responsible f or inspecting and evaluating the quality of equipment maintenance. The main aspects of equipment maintenance quality inspection include: ① incoming inspection of purchased spare pa rts and materials; ② process quality control and final inspection of self-made spare parts and repaired components; ③ quality checks on components and assemblies during the equipme nt repair process; ④ visual inspection, trial runs, accuracy assessments, and performance tests conducted after repairs are completed. 3) Quality Assurance System for Equipment Mai ntenance The planning, management, spare parts handling, production oversight, technical administration, financial control, and supply of maintenance materials for equipment repair  form an integrated whole. By effectively organizing and coordinating these various aspects of management, we can establish robust systems—complete with management regulations, ope rational standards, workflow processes, and performance evaluation methods—ultimately creating a comprehensive quality assurance system for equipment maintenance. This ensures high -quality repairs while continuously enhancing our overall maintenance expertise. 1.5.5 Spare Parts Management The process by which enterprises, based on economic and practical prin ciples, determine standard limits for spare parts inventory—such as the quantity of spares to keep in stock, the amount of capital allocated to inventory, and the optimal reserve d uration—after gathering relevant data and conducting both calculations and real-world statistical analysis, is known as  ""reserve quotas. "" Effective spare parts inventory control requires establishing these precise reserve quotas. There is a wide variety of maintenance spare parts, and the prices, demand, inventory  levels, and stockholding durations of these parts vary significantly. Different inventory control methods should be applied to spare parts of varying types and characteristics, as  inventory management must also focus on key priorities. Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance 53 The ABC analysis categoriz es inventory spare parts into 3 classes. (1) Class A Spare Parts. Class A spare parts are a small but critical subset of components, characterized by their high importance, challen ging procurement and manufacturing processes, elevated costs, and extended lead times for stockpiling. Although these parts account for approximately 10% of all spare part types, t hey consume around 80% of the total budget allocated to spare parts. Therefore, Class A items require stringent control measures. Employing inventory theory, carefully determine op timal stock levels and ordering schedules, while maintaining minimal safety stock levels. Additionally, strive to reduce order cycles by increasing the frequency of purchases, ther eby accelerating the turnover of spare parts inventory funds. In warehouse management, ensure meticulous recording of all incoming and outgoing spare parts, conduct thorough statis tical analysis and calculations of inventory levels, and rigorously implement preventive measures to protect components against corrosion and rust. (2) Category B spare parts. Thes e have a wider variety than Category A spare parts, accounting for about 25% of the total product range, but they require less capital investment—typically around 15% of the total  funds allocated to spare parts. Category B spare parts usually maintain a higher safety stock level, though their reserves can be managed more flexibly. Additionally, based on main tenance needs, the ordering cycle can be appropriately extended to reduce the frequency of purchases. (3) Category C spare parts. These account for approximately 65% of all part va rieties but represent only about 5% of the total funds allocated to spare parts. For Category C items, inventory levels can be maintained at a slightly higher level based on mainte nance needs, and order lead times can be extended accordingly. The focus of spare parts management should be placed on managing Class A and Class B spare parts.",text-EN.txt

124,"2.1.1 Main Failure Modes of Shaft-Type Components Shaft-type components are among the most critical parts in mechanical equipment, directly influencing both the operational precision and longevity of machinery. Their primary function is to support rotating components while transmitting motion and torque. Shafts can be categorized into three main types: rotating shafts (e.g., lathe spindles, shafts with pulleys), stationary shafts (e.g., train axle wheels, bicycle axles, or car front axles), and transmission shafts (e.g., leadscrews used on lathes). These shaft components are primarily designed to withstand various loads and efficiently transfer power. Structure Composition of the Shaft As shown in Figure 2.1, the shaft consists of three parts. 1—Shaft; 2, 5—Shaft ends; 3—Journal; 4—Shaft body Figure 2.1: Structural Components of the Shaft Axle head: The part that mates with transmission components or couplings and clutches. Journal: The part that fits into the bearing. Shaft body: The section connecting the shaft head and the shaft journal. Failure Modes of Shaft Components The main failure modes include fatigue fracture due to insufficient fatigue strength, plastic deformation or brittle fracture caused by inadequate static strength, wear, deformation exceeding allowable limits, and vibration, among others. Performance Requirements for Shaft Components The performance requirements for shaft-type components include sufficient tensile strength and stiffness; adequate impact toughness and high fatigue resistance; excellent machinability and hardenability; and, for friction-prone areas at the shaft journals, high hardness and wear resistance. Manufacturing Materials for Shaft Components Manufacturing materials typically include low-carbon steel, medium-carbon steel, or alloy steel, which are either forged or rolled. 2.1.2 Methods for Disassembling Shaft-Type Components Disassembly is part of the repair process; when cleaning equipment, disassembly should be performed first. However, after disassembly, assembly accuracy tends to decrease. A Case Study Tutorial on Fault Diagnosis and Repair of Mechatronic Systems 56",text-EN.txt
125,"Phenomenon After dismantling and cleaning the equipment components, it is impossible to restore them to their original mating precision. Cause Analysis The disassembly and cleaning work did not meet the required standards; additionally, the removed parts were poorly stored, resulting in moisture damage or physical injury—and in some cases, individual parts were even lost and replaced with substitutes. Hazardousness Hazardousness refers to the decline in mechanical equipment performance, potentially leading to complete failure and rendering the equipment unusable. Prevention and Control Measures",text-EN.txt
126,"(1) The work area for disassembly and cleaning must be kept clean; dusty environments or outdoor locations are prohibited. If it is necessary to carry out the work outdoors, dust-control measures must be implemented. (2) Before disassembly, you must familiarize yourself with the drawings. Proceed step-by-step according to the diagrams, and mark the mating components clearly, ensuring that the markings are consistent, unambiguous, and easily visible. If the components already have existing marks, verify them thoroughly before proceeding with disassembly. When disassembling identical yet numerous components, provide a schematic diagram and mark them according to the numbers shown on the diagram. (3) Removed parts must be stored properly and protected from moisture, damage, or loss.",text-EN.txt
127,"(4) For components that need to be heated before removal, the heating temperature should be maintained according to the design specifications or the equipment manufacturer’s instructions. (5) Machine parts are typically cleaned with kerosene, but precision components or rolling bearings must be washed again with gasoline after being thoroughly cleaned with kerosene. (6) All debris such as sediment, sand, or dirty oil inside oil holes and oil passages must be thoroughly removed, and then sealed with wooden plugs—never use cotton yarn or cloth scraps as substitutes for the plugs. (7) After cleaning, mechanical equipment components that cannot be assembled immediately should be properly stored to prevent dust from entering. (8) When assembling equipment components, first inspect the surface shapes and dimensional accuracy of parts relevant to the assembly. Only proceed with assembly after confirming they meet the required specifications.",text-EN.txt
128,"Removal Method (1) Striking and Disengaging. Striking involves using the force of a hammer to create relative movement between mating parts, allowing them to separate and achieve disassembly. This is a straightforward method suitable for simpler structures or when dealing with robust, non-critical components. When striking, proceed with caution—improper technique could easily damage the parts. Common tools used for this method include steel hammers, copper hammers, wooden mallets, punches, as well as copper, aluminum, and wooden shims. When removing rolling bearings by striking, always tap symmetrically from both sides; never concentrate the blows on just one side, as this could lead to cracking of the bearing raceway. (2) Press and pull disassembly. Press and pull methods are superior to impact disassembly because they apply force more evenly, allowing precise control over both the magnitude and direction of the force. As a result, these techniques reduce the risk of part misalignment or damage. This method is particularly suitable for dismantling larger components or parts with significant interference fits. Commonly used tools for this process include press benches and pull molds. (3) Hot disassembly. Hot disassembly leverages the thermal expansion properties of metals to separate parts, preventing issues like parts getting stuck or damaged—something that can occur with methods like impact or press disassembly. This technique is commonly used when the interference fit is significant (exceeding 0.1 mm), the components are large in size, or traditional disassembly methods prove impractical. In summary, choose the appropriate removal method based on how the parts fit together. If it’s a transition fit, you can use a tapping method. Remove the part; if it’s a press-fit assembly, you can use either press-off or heat-based disassembly methods. After removal, place the parts on a wooden board or a low surface. Chapter 2: Troubleshooting and Repair of Commonly Used Components 57 On the platform; smaller parts such as screws, nuts, washers, pins, and others can be placed in dedicated boxes. Long, slender components like spindles and lead screws can be hung vertically to prevent bending or deformation. Disassembly of spindle components: The relative positions of parts such as the housing and spindle are ensured using an error-compensation method. To prevent improper disassembly that could compromise assembly accuracy, make sure to mark the circumferential positions of bearings, washers, tool housings, and the spindle itself during disassembly. After removal, arrange the bearings and inner/outer washers separately into their respective groups—never mix them up. Additionally, keep the workbench and surrounding area thoroughly clean during disassembly, and immediately immerse removed parts in oil to prevent rusting. When reassembling, be sure to reinstall them precisely according to the original markings. 2.1.3 Cleaning, Inspection, and Repair After Shaft Removal",text-EN.txt
129,"Cleaning After Shaft Removal Cleaning the disassembled mechanical parts is a crucial step in maintenance work. The cleaning method and the quality of removal directly impact the accuracy of parts inspection. Certainty, the quality of equipment repair, maintenance costs, and service life will all be significantly impacted. Part cleaning involves removing oil stains, scale, carbon deposits, rust layers, and old paint coatings. The tools required for cleaning include wrenches, circlip pliers, cleaning solutions, grease, a hairdryer, cloths, needles, and a container specifically designed for soaking the shaft. Here’s a simple cleaning procedure: ① Remove the shaft from its position; ② Immerse and scrub the shaft in the cleaning solution; ③ Rinse the thoroughly cleaned shaft to remove any remaining residue; ④ Use a hairdryer to dry the shaft completely (drying prevents rusting); ⑤ Apply lubricating grease to protect against dust, water, and ensure smooth operation; ⑥ Once greased, reattach the side cover before proceeding with installation. 2. Inspection of the Spindle The main forms of spindle damage include journal wear, surface scratches, and the resulting roundness errors, concentricity errors, and bending deformation. Including cone hole dam age, keyway cracks, and thread failures. Common checks for the coaxiality of each spindle journal are shown in Figure 2.2. 1—Spindle; 2—Plug; 3—Steel ball; 4—Support plate; 5—V-sha ped frame; 6—Inspection flat plate Figure 2.2: Common Methods for Checking the Coaxiality of Each Journal on the Main Shaft The spindle 1 is placed on two V-shaped supports 5 mount ed on the inspection plate 6. The rear end of the spindle is fitted with a plug 2, which features a steel ball 3 positioned at the center hole and resting against the support plate  4. At each journal of the spindle, a dial indicator tip is brought into contact with the journal surface. By rotating the spindle, the difference in movement indicated by the dial  gauge pointer directly reflects the coaxial error. Additionally, the circular runout error at the shoulder end face can also be measured using the dial indicator positioned at the  end face. Generally, coaxial error should be kept within 0.015, and the face runout error should be less than 0.01 mm. As for the spindle taper bore... The radial runout error of  the spindle centerline relative to the bearing journal can be checked by inserting a tapered shank gauge into the properly positioned spindle taper bore. Then, touch the dial indic ator probe to two points on the tapered shank gauge—one near the spindle end and the other 300 mm away—and rotate the spindle while observing the dial indicator readings. The indic ator can be used to measure the radial circular runout of the tapered hole's centerline relative to the spindle bearing journal.

130,"3. Spindle Maintenance Under normal circumstances, the primary failure modes of spindles are bending deformation caused by external loads, as well as we ar on the mating surfaces. If a spindle becomes deformed, the repair method should be determined based on the extent of the deformation and the spindle's precision requirements. Fo r ordinary-precision spindles that have undergone bending deformation, straightening is an effective repair technique. However, for high-precision spindles, straightening often fai ls to restore their original accuracy, making it necessary to replace the spindle with a new one. After the spindle journal wears down, it usually needs to be restored to its origi nal dimensions. Commonly used methods include brush plating and chrome plating. The process for repairing the spindle using brush plating involves: first, inserting plugs into the  holes at both ends of the spindle; then, drilling a center hole in the plugs; next, precisely aligning the spindle on a grinding machine, using the unworn portions of the front and  rear journals as reference points; followed by grinding down the worn journal areas by 0.05 to 0.15 mm; finally, applying brush plating to the targeted outer cylindrical surfaces,  ensuring that the single-sided coating thickness is at least 0.1 mm. After brushing, the ground surfaces are carefully lapped to meet the required specifications. Additionally, th e spindle's Morse taper bore is also prone to wear, and during maintenance, its surface accuracy is often restored through grinding. If the spindle has undergone multiple rounds of  grinding, it can eventually be repaired by installing a sleeve. 2.2 Assembly Requirements for Interference-Fit Fasteners",text-EN.txt
131,"An interference fit involves fitting a larger component (t he shaft) into a smaller one (the hole). This type of connection can withstand significant axial forces, torque, and dynamic loads, while also providing high alignment accuracy and  wide-ranging applications. For instance, it’s commonly used to join gears, couplings, flywheels, sprockets, pulleys, and other components to their respective shafts, as well as in  the assembly of bearings with their housing sleeves. In an interference fit, since the shaft is larger in size than the hole, assembly must be carried out using methods such as applying pressure or employing thermal expansion/contraction techniques. Interference fits are primarily used for tight connections between holes and shafts where relative motion is not permitted—such as in the secure attachment of gear rims to wheel hubs in large gears. An interference fit is a type of fixed joint that not only demands precise positioning and reliable clamping but also ensures that the assembly process does not compromise the strength or accuracy of the components, while allowing for easy and rapid installation. The mating surfaces in interference connections can take various forms, including cylindrical, conical, and other specialized shapes. The assembly technical requirements for interference fit connections are as follows: (1) Accurate interference fit must be ensured to meet the design requirements after assembly. (2) The mating surface should have a low surface roughness. (3) Before assembly, ensure that the mating surfaces are clean, and make sure these surfaces are properly lubricated with oil. (4) The pressing process should be continuous, with a speed that is not too fast (typically 2.4 mm/s), and the pressing stroke must be accurately controlled. (5) During the pressing process, ensure that the axis of the shaft aligns perfectly with the axis of the hole. Regularly check using a 90° square to prevent any tilting. (6) For slender and thin-walled components, special attention should be paid to controlling the interference fit and geometric tolerances. During assembly, it's best to press them in vertically to prevent deformation of the parts. 2.3 Maintenance and Assembly of Sliding Bearings Sliding bearings feature a simple structure, ease of manufacturing, convenient assembly and disassembly, strong load-carrying capacity, as well as excellent shock resistance and vibration-absorbing properties. It features smooth operation, stable performance, and high rotational precision, making it ideal for applications involving exceptionally high operating speeds, extremely heavy loads, stringent requirements for shaft rotational accuracy, significant shock and vibration, limited radial space dimensions, or situations requiring split-type installation (such as bearings in crankshafts), as well as environments with specialized operational conditions. The main drawbacks are high starting friction resistance and demanding lubrication and maintenance requirements. Chapter 2: Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of General-Purpose Components",text-EN.txt

133,"Below, we'll use a solid sliding bearing as an example to introduce its assembly method. (1) Press-fitting the bushing. Depending on the bushing size and the amount of interference fit, assembly is carried out either by hammering or press-fitting. For smaller dimensions and lighter interference fits, the bushing can be tapped into place using a hand hammer and a backing plate. When the bushing size and interference are larger, a hydraulic press should be used for assembly. If the interference exceeds 0.1 mm, the assembly process involves heating the housing or cooling the bushing to facilitate proper fitting. (2) Fixed bushing. After the bushing is press-fitted, it can be secured against rotation using screws, locating pins, or similar fasteners. (3) Inspection and Adjustment After Assembly. After the bushing is assembled, methods such as reaming, scraping, or honing can be used to ensure that the clearance and contact points between the bushing and the journal meet the specified requirements. 2.3.1 Failure Modes of Sliding Bearings (1) Abrasive wear. Hard particles grinding against the shaft and bearing surfaces cause abrasive wear. (2) Scratches. Hard contour peak tips on the shaft surface scrape against the bearing, resulting in scratches. (3) Galling (adhesion). Galling occurs when temperatures rise, pressure increases, or the oil film breaks down. (4) Fatigue spalling. Repeated loading causes fatigue cracks to propagate, leading to spalling. (5) Corrosion. Oxidation of the lubricant produces acidic substances that cause corrosive damage.",text-EN.txt
134,"2.3.2 Installation and Maintenance of Sliding Bearings Sliding bearings are characterized by their reliable operation, smooth performance, quietness, strong vibration absorption due to the lubricating oil film, and ability to withstand significant impact loads. Sliding bearings can be categorized into various structural types, such as integral and split designs, as shown in Figure 2.3. Figure 2.3: Sliding Bearing Basic Requirements for Sliding Bearing Installation (1) Before installation, burrs and sharp edges on the parts of the sliding bearing should be removed, and the contact surfaces must be smooth and clean. (2) When installing the bearing housing, the bearing or bushing should be fitted onto the housing and aligned according to the center position of the bushing or shaft sleeve. All bearings on the same transmission shaft must lie on a single axis, with their coaxial error remaining within the specified tolerance range. The bottom surface of the bearing housing must also be properly aligned with the machine components. The contact surfaces should make even, tight contact, and the fixed connections must be secure. During operation, there should be no signs of loosening or shifting. (3) The contact condition between the bearing and the shaft surface can be checked using the dye-penetration method, and the number of contact points must meet the specified requirements. (4) When the shaft is rotating, no rotation of the bearing bush or shaft sleeve is permitted. Mechatronics System Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance Case Study Tutorial",text-EN.txt
135,"60 (5) When adjusting the clearance of split washers, ensure that the bearing surfaces have good contact accuracy and a proper clearance. (6) During installation, ensure that lubricating oil flows freely into the bearing and that there is an adequate reserve of oil within the bearing to form a proper oil film. Additionally, verify the quality of the sealing device to prevent oil from leaking out of the bearing, while also keeping dust from entering the bearing.",text-EN.txt
136,"2. Installation of Integral Sliding Bearings (1) Press-fit the sleeve. When the sleeve dimensions and interference fit are relatively small, a press-fitting method can be used—installing the sleeve by applying pressure with a press or gently tapping it into place using a hardwood block. For larger dimensions and interference fits, or when installing thin-walled sleeves, the thermal expansion method is recommended: cool the sleeve in dry ice or liquid nitrogen before fitting it into the bearing housing. During the press-fitting process, ensure that the mating surfaces are clean and apply a thin layer of lubricant to prevent the sleeve from becoming skewed. (2) Sleeve positioning. After pressing the sleeve into place, its position should be secured using the fastening screws or locating pins as specified in the drawing, to prevent the sleeve from rotating along with the shaft. The method for fixing the sleeve is shown in Figure 2.4. Figure 2.4: Method of Shaft Sleeve Fixation (3) Bore the bushing hole. After the bushing is press-fitted, the interference fit on the outer wall may cause the inner bore to shrink or deform. Therefore, reaming or scraping should be performed to ensure that the contact points between the bushing and the journal meet the specified standards. 3. Diagnosis and Maintenance of Sliding Bearings 1) The contact angle of the plain bearing bush does not meet the requirements. (1) Phenomenon: The contact angle between the bearing bush and the journal does not meet the standard requirements. (2) Cause analysis: Failure to follow the operational guidelines strictly during scraping, careless work practices, and weak foundational skills in the relevant techniques. (3) Harmfulness. If the contact angle between the bearing bush and the journal is too large, it becomes difficult for a lubricating oil film to form, resulting in inadequate lubrication. As a result, bearing wear is accelerated. If the contact angle is too small, it increases the pressure on the bearing, which in turn leads to rapid wear of the bearing as well. (4) Prevention and Control Measures: The contact angle between the bearing bush and the journal should be appropriately sized, typically maintained between 60° and 90°. For high-speed, low-load applications, The bearing contact angle can be set at 60°, while for low-speed, heavy-duty bearings, a contact angle of 90° is recommended. Babbitt metal scraping should be performed only after the equipment has been precisely leveled. The scraping process involves two key areas: first, scraping the contact surface between the babbitt backing (babbitt back) and the bearing housing; and second, scraping the contact area between the babbitt lining and the journal. The scraping and lapping of the bearing shell with the bearing housing should also not be overlooked. Specific requirements are as follows: the contact area between the lower bearing shell and the bearing seat must be at least 50% of the total surface area, while the contact area between the upper bearing shell and the bearing cap should be no less than 40%. Additionally, the contact points between the bearing shells and both the bearing housing and bearing cap should ideally consist of 1 to 2 points per cm². If the contact area is too small or the number of contact points is insufficient, it will cause the bearing bush to... Increased pressure per unit area accelerates the wear of the bearing bushing. When scraping the bearing bushing, all components on the shaft should be fully assembled. Typically, scraping begins with the lower half of the bushing before moving to the upper half. During the scraping process, a thin layer of red lead oil can be applied to the journal, and the journal is gently inserted into the bushing. Then, the shaft is rotated—first in one direction, then in the opposite—to ensure even contact across both halves of the bushing. This allows the bushing and journal to rub against each other. Afterward, the shaft is carefully lifted, and based on the condition of the scraped surface, it’s determined whether the contact angle and contact points meet the specified requirements. If they don’t, further adjustments using additional steps are necessary. Chapter 2: Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Commonly Used Components",text-EN.txt
137,"61 Scraping with a scraper. During scraping and lapping, within the 60°–90° contact angle range, the contact points should be dense in the middle, gradually becoming sparser toward the sides—this should not occur. The contact surface should have a clear boundary between the contacting and non-contacting areas. The scraping method for the upper bearing shell is identical to that used for the lower shell. When applying color to the shells, first securely install the upper shell, remove the shims from the shell opening, and then tighten the bearing cap firmly with screws—ensuring that the upper shell makes proper contact with the journal. 2) Insufficient contact points between the journal and bearing bushing (1) Phenomenon: The contact points between the bearing bush and the journal do not meet the requirements of the general construction and acceptance standards. (2) Cause analysis: The procedure and method used for scraping the bearing were inappropriate, and the operator was careless and inattentive, neglecting quality control during the process. (3) Hazardousness. Due to the contact points between the bearing bush and the journal not meeting the specified standards, this can cause the bearing bush to overheat during equipment operation, disrupting normal functioning. (4) Prevention and Control Measures: When scraping and lapping the bearing shells, follow the prescribed process procedures. After rotating the journal shaft back and forth once inside the bearing shell, evenly remove any black spots that appear using a scraper—each time you scrape, rotate the tool to a new direction, ensuring the resulting scratches form intersecting angles of 60° to 90°. At the contact and non-contact areas, there should be no obvious boundary; when touching the bearing surface with your hand, it should feel exceptionally smooth.",text-EN.txt
138,"3) Bearing overheating (1) Phenomenon: During equipment trial operation, bearing temperatures gradually increased, exceeding the specified requirements. (2) Cause analysis: Excessive or insufficient lubricating oil inside the bearing, or even complete absence of oil; impure lubricant can also lead to bearing overheating; and improper bearing assembly (such as misalignment, skewing, or lack of clearance). (3) Hazardous Effects: The materials used for bearings typically have lower strength and hardness compared to the materials used for shafts (e.g., in sliding bearings). When bearings overheat, this can lead to wear of the bearing alloy—under severe conditions, the alloy may even melt, causing the machinery to come to a halt. For rolling bearings, overheating also accelerates wear, significantly reducing their service life. (4) Prevention and Control Measures. First, thoroughly clean the lubrication system, then add the appropriate lubricant—selected according to the specified grade and quantity—as per the design requirements.",text-EN.txt
139,"Seek the appropriate lubricant. For bearings that have been improperly assembled, readjust them until they meet the design and specification requirements.",text-EN.txt
140,"4) Shaft Heating (1) Phenomenon: The transmission shaft heats up during operation. (2) Cause analysis. On one hand, the oil-seal pad or rubber ring on the shaft is too tight, causing heat generation due to friction during rotation. On the other hand, the clearance between the bearing cap and the shaft varies unevenly around the circumference, leading to shaft abrasion and, consequently, shaft heating. (3) Hazardous Effects. When the shaft's temperature rises, it reduces the shaft's hardness, accelerates wear, and also leads to damage in other components connected to the shaft. (4) Prevention and Control Measures: Replace the spring inside the rubber ring with a looser one, or loosen the bearing cap screws. Also, check whether the clearance between the bearing cap and the shaft complies with the specifications outlined in the equipment’s technical documentation. If it does not meet the requirements, make sure to adjust it carefully. 5) Bearing oil leakage (1) Phenomenon: Lubricant oil leakage from the bearing cap area during equipment operation. (2) Root cause analysis: The lubrication system is supplying excessive oil, resulting in excessively high oil pressure in the pressure lines—far exceeding the specified standards. Additionally, the return oil holes or pipes for the bearings are too small in size, while the number of oil seals is insufficient or improperly installed. As a result, oil leaks through gaps at the bearing housing due to inadequate sealing between the oil seal grooves and other components. (3) Hazardous effects: It depletes lubricating oil, fails to adequately ensure proper lubrication of the bearing itself, and leads to contamination of the equipment. (4) Prevention and Control Measures: Adjust the oil supply in the lubrication system to ensure an appropriate oil level; increase the diameter of the return oil pipe; properly repair the oil-seal groove and install the oil seals correctly; finally, tighten the bearing caps securely.

142,"Types of Rolling Bearings 1) By the direction of the load borne by the bearing or according to the nominal contact angle Category (1) Radial bearings. Radial contact bearings primarily withstand radial loads. Well, some can handle smaller axial loads; angular contact radial bearings. The bearing can simultaneously handle both radial and axial loads. (2) Thrust bearings. Thrust angular contact bearings primarily handle axial loads. The bearing can also handle smaller radial loads; axial thrust bearings, however, are designed only to withstand axial loads. 2) Classified by the shape of the rolling element Rolling bearings can be classified into ball bearings and roller bearings. 3) Classified by Whether the Working Shaft Can Be Centered Rolling bearings can be classified into self-aligning bearings and non-self-aligning bearings. 4) Classification Based on Whether Clearance Can Be Adjusted Rolling bearings can be classified into bearings with adjustable clearance and those with non-adjustable clearance. 3. Selection of Rolling Bearing Types Selection principle: Match bearing characteristics with operating conditions. 1) Type Selection (1) Load conditions. If the bearing is subjected to axial loads, thrust bearings are typically selected; if the load is purely axial, For smaller loads, thrust ball bearings are re commended; if the pure axial load is significant, thrust roller bearings should be chosen. When the bearing is subjected to pure radial loads, deep groove ball bearings, cylindrica l roller bearings, or needle roller bearings are typically used. If the bearing handles both radial and moderate axial loads simultaneously, deep groove ball bearings, angular cont act ball bearings with small contact angles, or tapered roller bearings are suitable options. For situations involving heavier axial loads, angular contact ball bearings with large r contact angles or tapered roller bearings are ideal. Alternatively, a combined design—using both radial and thrust bearings—can be employed, with each type of bearing specificall y handling either the radial or axial load. (2) Rotational speed requirements. When high speed and precise rotation are needed, ball bearings should be used as the preferred option . (3) Self-aligning capability requirement: When the shaft is long (with low rigidity) or has multiple support points and requires bearings with self-aligning features, choose self -aligning bearings. (4) Load-carrying and shock-resistant capabilities. Use roller bearings when dealing with heavy loads or impact loads. (5) Space limitations. Use roller bearing s when radial dimensions are restricted. 1—Inner race; 2—Outer race; 3—Rolling element; 4—Cage Figure 2.5: Structure of a Rolling Bearing",text-EN.txt
143,"Chapter 2: Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Commonly Used Components, p. 63 (6) Easy to assemble and disassemble. Choose tapered roller or cylindrical roller bearings when the i nner and outer rings are separable; opt for bearings with an internal taper bore and set-sleeve mounting when installing on long shafts. (7) Price: Ball bearings are low in price,  while roller bearings are higher. 2) Size Selection Model selection: inner diameter, outer diameter, width, selected type, preliminary model, and life verification. 4. Fit of Rolli ng Bearings The bearing fit refers to the mating between the inner ring and the journal, as well as the outer ring and the housing, influencing the bearing's radial clearance, oper ational accuracy, and service life. Rolling bearings are standard components, and the fit between the bearing bore and the shaft follows the hole basis system, while the fit betwee n the outer ring and the bearing housing uses the shaft basis system. Since the tolerance zone for the bearing inner diameter lies below the zero line, whereas in cylindrical toler ance standards, the tolerance zone for the reference hole is above the zero line, the interference fit between the inner ring and the journal is significantly tighter than the corr esponding hole-basis fits specified in cylindrical tolerance standards. Figures 2.6 and 2.7 illustrate the fit of rolling bearings and their relationship to deviations in the dimen sions of the journal or housing bore relative to the bearing’s reference surfaces (inner ring inner diameter, outer ring outer diameter). When designing, the type and size of the b earing, as well as the magnitude of the load, should guide the selection of the appropriate fit. For applications with large dimensions, heavy loads, significant vibrations, high r otational speeds, or elevated operating temperatures, a tighter fit is recommended. However, excessively tight fits can impair the bearing’s proper function and also make assembly  and disassembly more challenging. On the other hand, for components that require frequent removal or where the raceways experience movement, a looser fit should be chosen. However,  excessive looseness is detrimental to improving bearing rotational accuracy and reducing vibration. As shown in Figure 2.7, the rotating shaft typically fitted with the inner ring  of the bearing is Use interference fits N6, M6, K6, or k5, or transition fits j5 and J6; bearing housing bores that are paired with non-rotating outer rings typically employ transition fits J6 and J7, or clearance fits such as H7 and G7.

Failure Modes of Rolling Bearings Pitting: Numerous pitting marks appear on the raceways of both the inner and outer rings, as well as on the surfaces of the rolling elements—primarily caused by improper loading, incorrect assembly (e.g., excessive interference fit or misalignment of the inner and outer rings), and inadequate lubrication. Plastic Deformation: Uneven plastic deformation pits appear on the rolling elements or raceway surfaces, primarily due to excessive static or impact loads. Other forms include abrasive wear, adhesive wear, fracture, rusting, electrochemical corrosion, and abnormal temperature rise, among others.",text-EN.txt
145,"The main factors influencing rolling bearing failure include load conditions, lubrication, assembly practices, environmental factors, and material quality or manufacturing precision. When determining bearing dimensions, it's essential to perform the necessary calculations tailored to the primary failure modes. For rotating rolling bearings under typical operating conditions, both contact fatigue life and static strength analyses are usually required. In contrast, for oscillating or low-speed bearings, only a static strength calculation is sufficient. Meanwhile, high-speed bearings are prone to adhesive wear and scoring caused by heat generation, making these failure modes their main concerns. Therefore, in addition to conducting life calculations, it’s also crucial to verify the bearing’s limiting speed. 2.4.3 Disassembly, Cleaning, and Inspection of Rolling Bearings",text-EN.txt
146,"When designing bearing assemblies, consider the ease of installation and removal to prevent damage to the bearing and other components during these processes. Bearing installation: Small bearings can be gently and evenly tapped into place using a copper hammer to fit the retaining rings; larger bearings should be pressed in with a hydraulic press. Bearings that are large in size and tightly fitted can be heated to expand the bore before assembly. Bearing installation and removal: Specialized tools can be used; when designing the structure, ensure ease of bearing installation and removal. 1. Disassembling Rolling Bearings Disassembling rolling bearings is an essential part of mechanical maintenance. Since rolling bearings are tightly fitted to the shaft, significant force is required to remove them. If the disassembly method is improper, not only may the bearing fail to come off, but if the fit is particularly tight—with a large interference—the process could also damage the bearing and its associated components. Here, we introduce several commonly used methods for removing bearings. (1) Heating Disassembly Method. If the bearing is tightly fitted and has a significant interference fit, the bearing must be heated to induce thermal expansion, causing elastic deformation that allows for easy removal. For instance, you can wrap the shaft near the bearing with asbestos cloth and then heat the inner race of the bearing using an acetylene-oxygen flame—this method enables disassembly while heating continues. However, it’s crucial to heat slowly, keeping the temperature around 100°C to prevent damage to the bearing. (2) If the bearing has a loose fit, you can carefully tap the fitting ring of the bearing with a wooden mallet to remove it. When tapping, make sure to work evenly around the circumference—avoid focusing on just one spot repeatedly. In some cases, a steel hammer may also be used, but in this scenario, always place a wooden block between the hammer and the bearing to ensure that the force is distributed evenly across the bearing, preventing damage. (3) Select a metal material to create a sleeve, ensuring the inner diameter of the sleeve is slightly larger than the journal diameter. During removal, support the sleeve with an appropriate object. If the fit is loose, gently tap the shaft end with a hammer to detach the bearing; if the fit is tight, apply force to the shaft end using a press or jack. Alternatively, if using the sleeve proves inconvenient, you can also substitute it with two clamping plates.

This method can be used for disassembly, as shown in Figure 2.8. (5) If the bearing cannot be pulled out using a puller, The ring can simultaneously cool the outer race of the bearing locally using dry ice, yet… Then quickly pull the outer race of the tapered roller bearing out of the gear. 2. Bearing Cleaning (1) Hot Oil Cleaning Method. For bearings hardened by soft dry oil or rust-preventive grease, immerse them in hot motor oil heated to 100–200°C. Use pliers to grip the bearing and gently scrub away any oil contamination with a brush. When heated to 100–200°C, soft dry oil or rust-preventive grease will melt, allowing it to easily flush out of the bearing’s crevices. In some cases, simply shaking the bearing repeatedly in the oil is enough to dislodge the dirt and grime from between the gaps. When cleaning the radial spherical ball bearings of old or imported electric motors, the balls, retainer, and inner ring should be carefully turned horizontally out of the outer ring before being immersed in hot oil. Similarly, when cleaning short cylindrical roller bearings, the rollers, retainer, inner ring, and outer ring must first be separated from one another. When cleaning with hot oil, the oil temperature should not exceed 20°C. If using an open flame for direct heating, be careful to prevent the oil from catching fire. The bearing should be suspended inside the oil pot—immersing it completely at the bottom could cause overheating and reduce its hardness. (2) General Cleaning Method: Place the bearing in kerosene and soak it for 5–10 minutes. While holding the inner ring with one hand, gently rotate the outer ring with the other—this will cause any soft dry grease or rust-preventive paste on the bearing to fall off. Next, transfer the bearing to a container of cleaner kerosene and use a fine, soft-bristled brush to thoroughly clean away oil stains from the raceways and between the rolling elements. Finally, rinse the bearing once more in gasoline before carefully placing it onto a clean piece of paper. When cleaning spherical ball bearings and short cylindrical roller bearings, separate the balls, retainer cage, inner ring, and outer ring for individual cleaning. For bearings already mounted on a shaft, cleaning is typically done by pouring oil directly over them or using an oil gun for targeted spraying. Start with kerosene to remove easily loosened oil deposits, followed by gasoline for tougher residues. If oil stains persist, first apply hot engine oil heated to 100–200°C via pouring or spraying, then finish with gasoline. Always remember not to scrape off hardened oil buildup or rust from the bearing surfaces using sharp tools, as this could damage the smoothness of the rolling elements and raceway grooves. After cleaning, dry the bearing thoroughly with a clean cloth. 3. Inspection of Rolling Bearings For rolling bearings, focus should be placed on inspecting the inner and outer raceways. The entire working surface must be smooth, free from defects such as cracks, micropores, dents, and peeling. Similarly, the surfaces of the rolling elements themselves should be flawless, with no cracks, micropores, or dents. Additionally, the retainer must remain intact, and all rivets should be securely fastened. If clearance is detected between the inner and outer races of the bearing, avoid replacing it immediately—instead, consider adjusting it through preloading to eliminate any increased clearance caused by wear, thereby enhancing its rotational accuracy. 2.4.4 Assembly of Rolling Bearings Rolling bearings consist of an inner ring, outer ring, rolling elements, and a cage—they are the bearing components that enable relative motion between the shaft and the bearing housing through rolling friction. Rolling bearings offer advantages such as low friction coefficients, high efficiency, compact axial dimensions, and ease of assembly and disassembly, making them widely used in various types of machinery and equipment. As standardized components mass-produced by specialized factories, rolling bearings come with predetermined inner diameters, outer diameters, and axial widths at the time of manufacture. Consequently, the inner ring of a rolling bearing serves as the reference hole, while the outer ring acts as the reference shaft. Figure 2.8: Tutorial on Diagnosing and Repairing Electromechanical System Failures in Tensioners – Bearing Disassembly Case 66",text-EN.txt
148,"Rolling bearings are precision components, and careful attention should be paid to both the pre-installation preparations and the quality of the installation process—along with noting the following points. (1) Before installation, prepare the necessary tools and measuring instruments. Carefully inspect the surface dimensions of all parts that will be fitted with the bearing to ensure they meet the requirements specified in the drawings. Then, clean these surfaces thoroughly with gasoline or kerosene, wipe them dry, and apply a thin layer of system lubricant oil (machine oil). (2) Verify that the bearing model matches the drawing. (3) The installation method for rolling bearings should be determined based on the bearing’s design, size, and the nature of the fit between its components.",text-EN.txt
149,"2.4.5 Clearance in Rolling Bearings and Its Adjustment The clearance in rolling bearings ensures proper operation of the rolling elements, facilitates lubrication, and accommodates thermal expansion. However, the clearance in rolling bearings must not be too large—or too small. If the clearance is excessive, it reduces the number of rolling elements simultaneously bearing the load, increasing the load on each individual element, which in turn shortens the bearing’s lifespan and compromises rotational accuracy, potentially leading to noise and vibration. On the other hand, if the clearance is too tight, it can easily cause overheating and accelerate wear, again negatively impacting the bearing’s longevity. Therefore, adjusting the clearance during bearing installation is an extremely critical task. There are three commonly used methods for adjusting rolling bearing clearance: the shim method, the screw adjustment method, and the combined adjustment method. 2.4.6 Preloading in Rolling Bearing Assembly Preloading refers to applying an axial load to the bearing during installation, inducing a slight pre-deformation between the rolling elements and the inner and outer rings, thereby enabling the bearing to operate with negative clearance. Preloading increases bearing stiffness, enhances rotational accuracy, and extends bearing life. The preload amount should be determined appropriately based on the bearing's load conditions and application requirements. Excessive preload, however, can increase bearing wear and heat generation, ultimately reducing the bearing's service life. Preloading paired angular contact bearings can enhance their operational stiffness. Common methods for controlling preload include adding metal shims, grinding down the raceways, or adjusting the widths of the inner and outer sleeves between the two bearings. 2.5 Gear Drive Maintenance and Assembly",text-EN.txt
150,"2.5.1 Characteristics and Applications of Gear Transmission Gear transmission is one of the most commonly used methods of power transmission, relying on the meshing of gear teeth to transfer motion and power. It is characterized by its ability to ensure an accurate transmission ratio, handle a wide range of power and speed levels, achieve high transmission efficiency, maintain a compact design, and offer long service life—though gear transmissions do require relatively high precision in manufacturing and assembly. There are several types of gear transmissions, which can be classified in different ways into straight teeth, helical teeth, and herringbone gear drives. They can also be categorized into cylindrical gears, bevel gears, and rack-and-pinion gear systems, among others. 2.5.2 Failure Modes of Gear Drives and Preventive Measures",text-EN.txt
151,"Working Conditions Power is transmitted through tooth surface contact, with the two tooth surfaces meshing together in a motion that involves both rolling and sliding. The gear surface is subjected to alternating contact compressive stress and friction forces; the tooth root, meanwhile, experiences alternating bending stress. Now, let’s move on to Chapter 2: Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Commonly Used Mechanical Components. 67 It will experience impact during engagement. Poor installation can lead to improper tooth surface contact. 2. Failure Modes Gear failure modes include tooth fracture and surface damage failures, such as pitting, wear, and plastic deformation. 1) Tooth fracture Classified by failure mechanisms, we have: fatigue fracture—occurs when a cantilever beam is subjected to fluctuating bending stresses or stress concentrations, causing fatigue cracks to propagate from the tensile side at the tooth root until final fracture; overload fracture—resulting from excessively high impact loads or short-term, severe overloading; and wear-induced fracture, where severe tooth wear reduces the gear's static strength, ultimately leading to failure. There are two forms of fracture in terms of morphology: complete fracture and partial fracture. From a design perspective, the gear teeth should undergo calculations to assess their root bending strength. From a manufacturing standpoint, increasing the radius of the fillet at the tooth root, reducing surface roughness, applying surface hardening treatments, and minimizing machining-induced damage on the tooth flank can all help enhance the tooth's resistance to fatigue failure. Additionally, improving the stiffness of the shaft and supports—and ideally eliminating any uneven distribution of loads—can significantly reduce the likelihood of localized tooth fractures. 2) Pitting corrosion",text-EN.txt
152,"When gears are in operation, prolonged exposure to pulsating cyclic stresses can cause tiny metal flakes to detach, resulting in the formation of shallow pits. Phenomenon: Pitting typically occurs in well-lubricated, closed gear drives. The specific locations are usually near the pitch line, where relative sliding velocities are low, making it difficult to form a lubricant film. In spur gear drives, contact stresses are also relatively high, further increasing the likelihood of pitting. To reduce pitting, the following measures can be taken: From a design perspective, the gear should undergo calculations to ensure adequate tooth surface contact strength. From a manufacturing perspective, In terms of engineering, the tooth surface hardness should be increased, and its roughness reduced; appropriate modification should be employed; lubricants with higher viscosity should be used; and dynamic loads should be minimized.",text-EN.txt
153,"3) Gear Surface Galling Galling refers to the wear phenomenon caused by the direct contact and adhesion of metal surfaces with interlocking teeth under specific pressure, followed by the tearing off of metal from the tooth surfaces as they move relative to each other. Gluing types include hot gluing and cold gluing. Hot gluing is used for gear transmissions under heavy loads and high speeds, while cold gluing is suitable for gear transmissions involving heavy loads at low speeds. Gluing typically occurs at the top of the gears. To enhance resistance to galling, you can increase the hardness of the tooth surfaces and reduce their roughness. Alternatively, you can also use lubricants with higher viscosity (for low-speed transmissions) or those specifically designed to resist galling (for high-speed transmissions). 4) Tooth Surface Wear Tooth surface wear occurs in two forms: abrasive wear and running-in wear. Abrasive wear happens in open gear drives, while running-in wear typically refers to the running-in process under light loads. Switching to closed-gear transmission is the most effective method to prevent abrasive wear on gear surfaces. Additionally, abrasive wear can be minimized by increasing the surface hardness of the gears, reducing surface roughness, and ensuring proper lubrication. 5) Plastic Deformation of Tooth Surfaces The cause of plastic deformation on gear surfaces is the plastic flow of the softer gear material under heavy loads or frictional forces, resulting in grooves being rolled into the driving gear and protruding ridges being extruded onto the driven gear. This failure typically occurs in transmissions operating at low speeds, under heavy loads, and with frequent start-ups. Measures such as increasing the hardness of gear tooth surfaces and using high-viscosity lubricants can help prevent or reduce plastic deformation on the tooth surfaces.

155,"3. Gear Inspection After gears have operated for a period of time, tooth profile errors increase due to wear on the tooth surfaces, which ultimately affects their performance. Therefore, it is essential that the gear teeth remain intact, with no signs of extrusion deformation, cracks, or broken teeth. Additionally, wear on the tooth thickness should be kept within limits—not exceeding 0.15 times the module. In production, specialized gear thickness calipers are commonly used to check for deviations in tooth thickness, effectively controlling backlash by measuring the reduction in tooth thickness. Alternatively, a universal involute micrometer can be employed to assess variations in the length of the gear’s normal chord, ensuring precise gear motion accuracy. This method is simple and practical, making it widely adopted in manufacturing processes. Furthermore, the gear’s internal bore, keyways, splines, and threads must all meet standard specifications, with no instances of scoring or damage allowed. 2.5.3 Gear Maintenance and Repair The methods for gear repair are primarily determined based on the gear's failure mode, production technology conditions, and application requirements. For small to medium module gears, if spare parts are readily available, repairs are typically avoided in favor of replacing the gear entirely with a new one. However, when replacing gears, it’s generally recommended to swap them in pairs to ensure optimal meshing performance. If spare parts aren’t sufficient, large gears can be repaired using precision finishing techniques, while smaller gears are replaced altogether. For worn-out large-module gears, dimensional restoration can be achieved through spraying, followed by fine finishing of the tooth surfaces. In cases where large-module gears suffer from broken teeth or cracks, repair methods such as tooth insertion or weld patching are employed. 2.5.4 Assembly and Adjustment of Cylindrical Gears",text-EN.txt
156,"The basic requirements for gear transmission are that the installation position must be correct; the tooth side clearance must meet technical specifications; and the contact spot distribution should be uniform and properly positioned. Gear and shaft assemblies are mostly secured using keys. For gears subjected to axial forces, screws and retaining rings are used to prevent axial movement and ensure proper positioning on the shaft. When transmitting high torque, a transition fit with a larger interference fit is often employed to create a tight, static connection—this typically requires either press-fitting or thermal assembly methods. Here are several common types of errors that occur during the assembly of gears and shafts: 1. Loosening of the cylindrical gear shaft bore (1) Phenomenon: The gear and gear shaft are not tightly fitted together. (2) Cause analysis: The inner bore of the gear was machined incorrectly, resulting in a flared shape. (3) H azardous effects: During operation, lateral oscillation occurs, accelerating wear on both the hole and shaft. Additionally, significant vibration during operation leads to low tran smission efficiency. (4) Prevention and control measures: The internal bore of the gear should be re-machined, and the gear should be replaced if necessary.",text-EN.txt
157,"2. Gear Runout (1) Phen omenon: The gear centerline does not coincide with the shaft centerline. (2) Cause analysis: Significant assembly dimension errors. (3) Hazardous Effects. When the equipment is run ning, radial runout occurs in the gear transmission. Additionally, the meshing tooth sections experience impacts and noise due to the continuous variation in pitch circle diameter.  If the eccentricity of the centerline exceeds a certain limit, jamming may occur, disrupting the smooth operation of the equipment. (4) Prevention and Control Measures: The gear t ransmission system must be assembled correctly, with all necessary inspections and adjustments performed. Special attention should be paid to ensuring proper alignment of the locat ing keys between the shaft and gears, as well as maintaining appropriate tightness. Any existing issues should be carefully addressed through repairs, and if needed, relevant compo nents should be replaced. Chapter 2: Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of General-Purpose Components",text-EN.txt
158,69,text-EN.txt
159,"3. Gear Misalignment (1) Phenomenon: The gear becomes skewed when assembled on to the shaft. (2) Cause analysis: Rough and careless assembly; excessive dimensional errors in component machining. (3) Hazardous Effects: When gears are improperly aligned during  assembly on the shaft, end-face runout will occur during equipment operation. This leads to uneven loading between meshing gear pairs, resulting in excessive wear. (4) Prevention a nd Control Measures: Reassembly and adjustment should be performed. If the inspection confirms that the issue is indeed caused by excessive machining errors in the gear shaft bore,  the gear should be replaced. 4. Poor Gear Meshing Performance (1) Phenomenon: The gear was not properly seated against the shaft shoulder during assembly. (2) Cause analysis: The  transmission shaft end is too long; the gear lacks sufficient width during machining; the gear is incorrectly assembled. (3) Harmfulness. During gear assembly, the gears were not p roperly seated against the shaft shoulders, resulting in wide contact between the meshing gears along the axial direction. Meanwhile, the remaining portion of the tooth width exper ienced poor meshing, which further increased the load on those specific teeth. (4) Prevention and Control Measures: The position of the gear on the shaft must be accurately assembl ed according to standard requirements. For components with excessive dimensional deviations, necessary adjustments should be made. 5. Abnormal gear transmission (1) Phenomenon: Abn ormal gear transmission and difficult starting. (2) Cause analysis: The gear retaining key is loose; the gear tooth profile is non-standard or damaged; excessive assembly errors in  the gears; too much oil present.",text-EN.txt
160,"(3) Hazardous consequences: Gear wear accelerates or causes breakage, leading to malfunction. (4) Prevention and Control Measures: If the gear key becomes loose, it should be securely re-tightened. If the tooth profile exceeds the allowable tolerance or is severely damaged, it should be properly repaired. If the gear assembly is improperly aligned, adjustments must be made. And if there is excessive oil, it should be limited according to the specified guidelines.",text-EN.txt
161,"2.5.5 Assembly and Adjustment of Bevel Gears The assembly of a bevel gear transmission mechanism is essentially similar to that of a cylindrical gear transmission mechanism, with the key difference being that the axes of the two gears intersect at the apex of a cone, forming a specified angle. Typically, the geometric position of the bevel gear axes is determined by the machining accuracy of the housing, while axial positioning relies on the back cone of the bevel gear as a reference. During assembly, the back-cone surfaces must align precisely to ensure proper gear alignment. Depending on whether the contact pattern shifts toward the tooth tip or root, the gear positions should be adjusted and repositioned along the axis accordingly. Axial positioning is usually achieved by shims placed between the bearing housings and the housing itself. Since bevel gears are designed for transmitting motion between perpendicular shafts, the machining of the two vertical bearing housing bores in the housing must strictly adhere to the specified technical requirements. 2.5.6 Assembly and Adjustment of Worm Gear Pair The worm gear mechanism is used to transmit motion and power between two perpendicular shafts, with an intersection angle of 90°. Its key transmission characteristics include: a high gear ratio, a compact design, self-locking capability, smooth operation, and low noise—but it suffers from relatively low transmission efficiency, higher friction, and significant heat generation, which limits the power it can handle, typically up to P ≤ 5 kW. The worm wheel gear ring is usually made from more expensive bronze, resulting in higher manufacturing costs, making this mechanism particularly suitable for applications like speed reduction and lifting equipment. Based on the shape of the worm, worm gear drives can be classified into cylindrical worm drives, globoidal worm drives, and bevel worm drives, with cylindrical worms being the most widely used. Mechatronics System Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance Case Study Tutorial",text-EN.txt
162,"70 1. Assembly Technical Requirements for Worm Gear Mechanisms (1) The worm shaft axis must be perpendicular to the worm wheel shaft axis, and the worm shaft axis should lie within the symmetrical plane of the worm wheel. (2) The center distance between the worm wheel and the worm must be accurate. (3) There is adequate backlash and normal contact patterns. (4) After assembly, it should rotate smoothly without any sticking or binding, and the force should be evenly distributed. 2. The Assembly Process of the Worm Gear Mechanism The worm gear mechanism consists of components such as the housing, worm wheel, and worm. The sequence of assembly is determined by the structural design of the mechanism. Typically, the worm wheel is installed first, followed by the worm, and finally, adjustments are checked and made. The process of installing the worm gear onto the shaft and the corresponding inspection method are identical to those used for installing cylindrical gears. Inspect the radial runout of both the worm gear and the worm. Runout and face runout are also the same as for cylindrical gears. The housing is the main body of the worm gear mechanism; typically, the position of the worm shaft axis is determined by the mounting holes in the housing. The axial position of the worm, however, does not affect assembly quality. To ensure that the worm axis lies within the symmetrical center plane of the worm wheel teeth, the axial position of the worm wheel can be adjusted by modifying the thickness of shims or using alternative methods. Meanwhile, the distance between the worm’s central line and the worm wheel’s central line is primarily maintained by the precision of machining processes—and fine-tuned further through shim adjustments.

168,"3.1.1 Components of the Hydraulic Transmission System A hydraulic transmission system is a type of drive system that utilizes various components to form customized control circuits, enabling it to perform specific control functions. Thanks to its unique technical advantages—such as high power-to-weight ratio, stepless speed regulation, advanced automation capabilities, and effective overload protection—hydraulic transmission has found widespread application across numerous industries. In particular, the integration of computer technology, mechatronics, and optimization techniques into modern hydraulic systems and components is driving the evolution of hydraulic transmission toward higher pressure, greater speed, increased power output, enhanced efficiency, reduced noise levels, lower energy consumption, superior durability, and highly integrated designs. As shown in Figure 3.1, this is a simple hydraulic transmission system for a machine tool workbench. From Figure 3.1(a), it can be seen that the hydraulic cylinder is fixed to the machine bed, while the piston rod is connected to the workbench, enabling reciprocating motion. The hydraulic pump 3, driven by an electric motor (not shown in the figure), draws oil from the oil tank 1 through filter 2 and then delivers the fluid—via throttle valve 5 and directional control valve 6—into the left chamber of the workbench’s hydraulic cylinder, pushing the piston and, consequently, the workpiece. The workbench moves to the right, at which point the oil from the right chamber of the workbench's hydraulic cylinder flows back to the oil tank 1 via the directional control valve 6. If the handle of directional control valve 6 is moved to the left, as shown in Figure 3.1(b), the oil pressed into the left chamber of the worktable hydraulic cylinder via directional control valve 6 will be drained back to the oil tank 1 through the same valve. By switching the oil flow path using the directional control valve, the reciprocating motion of the worktable is achieved. The speed of the worktable’s movement is adjusted by throttle valve 5: when the throttle valve 5 is fully open, the worktable moves faster; conversely, when the throttle valve 5 is partially closed, the worktable moves more slowly. 1—Fuel tank; 2—Filter; 3—Hydraulic pump; 4—Relief valve; 5—Throttle valve; 6—Directional control valve",text-EN.txt
169,"Figure 3.1: Simple Machine Tool Worktable Hydraulic Transmission System By adjusting the preload of the spring in overflow valve 4, you can set the pressure of the hydraulic fluid output by hydraulic pump 3. The hydraulic oil then pushes the hydraulic… The cylinder piston overcomes resistance to move the worktable. When the pressure exceeds the set value, overflow valve 4 opens, allowing the oil to flow back into tank 1—thus, ov erflow valve 4 serves both as a pressure regulator and an overflow device. Meanwhile, filter 2 functions to filter and purify the hydraulic oil. As shown in the example above, a hy draulic transmission system consists of five parts in total. (1) Power unit. The most common type is the hydraulic pump, which converts mechanical energy into pressure energy of th e oil fluid. Its function is to supply pressure energy to the hydraulic system, serving as the power source for the entire hydraulic system. Chapter 3: Fault Diagnosis and Maintena nce of Hydraulic Systems (2) Actuating devices. Typically referring to hydraulic cylinders and hydraulic motors, these devices convert the pressure energy of oil into mechanical en ergy. Their function is to deliver force and velocity (or torque and rotational speed) under the propulsion of pressurized oil, thereby driving the working components. (3) Control  and regulating devices. These include control valves for pressure, flow, direction, and more—they are the components that manage and adjust the oil pressure, flow, or direction wit hin the hydraulic system. Different combinations of these elements create hydraulic systems with varying functions, ensuring that the actuating components perform their intended mo tion tasks effectively. (4) Auxiliary devices. These refer to any equipment other than the three types mentioned above, such as fuel tanks, filters, accumulators, oil lines, and mo re. Each of these components serves specific functions—like cooling, oil storage, oil transportation, connection, filtration, pressure measurement, and flow rate monitoring—and col lectively play a crucial role in ensuring the reliable and stable operation of the hydraulic system. (5) The transmission medium, typically hydraulic oil, serves to transmit motion  and power. As a result, it becomes clear that hydraulic transmission relies on pressurized fluid contained within a sealed volume to transfer both motion and force.",text-EN.txt
170,"3.1.2 Analysis  of Failure Causes in the Hydraulic System Hydraulic systems can experience a wide range of failures during operation, with the primary causes rooted in issues related to design, m anufacturing, usage practices, and hydraulic oil contamination. Among hydraulic component failures, the hydraulic pump accounts for the highest failure rate—approximately 30% of al l hydraulic component malfunctions—making it essential to pay close attention to this issue. Additionally, many hydraulic system failures are also caused by improper selection of w orking fluids or inadequate maintenance practices. In fact, 70% to 80% of all hydraulic system failures are directly linked to contaminants present in the hydraulic oil, and among these oil-related failures, about 90% are attributed to impurities. Another significant cause of failure stems from natural wear, aging, and degradation that occur under normal operating conditions. Impurities pose a serious threat to hydraulic systems, as they can accelerate component wear, increase leakage, impair system performance, and shorten component lifespan—even leading to equipment damage or complete system failure. The following sections will focus on analyzing failures caused by improper design, manufacturing processes, incorrect usage practices, and hydraulic oil contamination.",text-EN.txt
171,"Design rationale When a hydraulic system malfunctions, the first step should generally be to analyze the rationality of its design. The design's suitability directly impacts the sy stem's operational performance, which becomes particularly evident during failure analysis of hydraulic systems in imported equipment. This issue is closely tied to how production  processes are organized internationally—many foreign manufacturers rely on collaborative approaches, which can sometimes lead to hydraulic systems being designed that don’t fully a lign with the specific application conditions and requirements of the equipment. For example, the hydraulic system of a certain vertical mill hydraulic press primarily operates in  pressure-holding mode during operation due to the minimal displacement of the grinding rollers. Therefore, during the pressure-holding phase, the system must keep the hydraulic pum p unloaded to minimize heat generation, ensuring that the viscosity of the hydraulic oil doesn’t fluctuate excessively—and thus maintaining consistent cement production capacity. T he hydraulic system of the imported equipment, however, was designed with the common overflow valve–loaded unloading method, which clearly stems from an inherently flawed design ap proach. When designing a hydraulic system, it’s essential not only to ensure the hydraulic circuit can meet the actuator’s operational requirements but also to pay close attention  to the layout of hydraulic components—particularly the positioning of component outlets during the design and implementation of stackable valves. For instance, in a circuit compris ing a 3-position directional control valve, a pilot-operated check valve, and a flow-control throttle valve, the pilot-operated check valve must be directly connected to the direct ional control valve, while the latter must feature a Y-type center position function. On the other hand, in circuits using an electro-hydraulic directional control valve with an M-type center position, either an external control method should be adopted, or an internal control approach incorporating a pre-loaded check valve—both aimed at guaranteeing proper  switching of the pilot-operated valve. Secondly, pay attention to factors such as the rationality of the fuel tank design and the optimal layout of the piping system. In environmen ts with harsh operating conditions, ensure proper protection for exposed hydraulic components. For instance, in the metallurgical industry, the piston rods of hydraulic cylinders a re often left exposed, directly surrounded by airborne contaminants. During their continuous reciprocating motion—extending and retracting—the piston rods not only suffer wear from  abrasive particles and corrosion caused by corrosive gases in the atmosphere, but they may also allow contaminants to infiltrate through the clearance between the piston rod and t he guide sleeve, potentially leading to failures in the machinery's diagnostic and maintenance procedures.",text-EN.txt
172,"74 Fluids can further accelerate wear on hydraulic cylinder components. T o mitigate this issue, designers can incorporate protective sleeves onto the piston rods during the structural design phase, safeguarding their exposed sections and thereby reducin g or preventing the aforementioned risks. Unfortunately, some engineers, seeking to simplify the process, inadvertently specify  ""spray green textured paint on both the inner and outer surfaces of the oil tank "" in the technical requirements of the tank’s blueprint. As a result, manufacturers naturally skip the critical step of acid phosphating the tank’s internal surface. Over time, as  the paint on the inner surface begins to peel off, it can clog the hydraulic pump’s suction filter, leading to potential system failures. Hydraulic pump cavitation or failure to achieve sufficient pressure.",text-EN.txt
173,"2. Manufacturing Cause Equipment manufacturing and component production often proceed smoothly with no issues in the overall design—but unexpected failures still tend to arise during installation and commissioning. For instance, at one company, the valve test bench of a multifunctional hydraulic component testing station failed to perform pressure tests during debugging. Upon inspection, it was discovered that the oil passages connecting the integrated block had been improperly machined, causing the pressure and return lines to inadvertently merge. As a result, sufficient pressure couldn’t be built up. After reworking the affected areas, the issue was resolved, allowing the commissioning process to proceed smoothly and successfully complete. For instance, improper clearance between the valve body and spool of a slide valve can lead to leakage or seizing. Additionally, if the mating surfaces between the valve body and the machine housing fail to meet manufacturing tolerances for flatness, deformation may occur under tightening pressure after assembly, causing the spool to become stuck inside the valve body—resulting in restricted or complete blockage of movement. Furthermore, during manufacturing, some valve bodies may not undergo reliable stress-relief treatments. As a result, residual stresses redistribute over time during operation, leading to deformation of the valve body. This not only compromises the original fit and function but also causes the slide valve to move sluggishly or even jam completely within the valve body. Some manufacturers fail to flush the hydraulic system during final assembly, opting instead to rely on cleaning components individually as they are assembled—thus skipping the critical step of flushing the system itself. This practice often leaves behind contaminants introduced during the assembly process, which can become a significant and frequently overlooked cause of system failures. Hydraulic system flushing involves using fluid flow at specific pressure and velocity levels to thoroughly clean and rinse every circuit within the entire system. However, cleaning components before assembly cannot replace the essential step of flushing the system after it has been fully assembled. During assembly, there’s always a risk of damaging seals or scratching/abrasively affecting metal parts. Additionally, adhesives, liquid sealants, or PTFE tape used when connecting pipes and components may inadvertently get pushed into the system, introducing contaminants that compromise its performance even after assembly is complete. 3. Reason for Use",text-EN.txt
174,"Improper use and maintenance of hydraulic systems not only increase the frequency of equipment failures but also significantly reduce the lifespan of the equipment. For instance, operating equipment under overload or over-speed conditions, exposing it to harsh environmental conditions, engaging in unsafe practices, or failing to perform timely maintenance can all accelerate the deterioration of hydraulic system performance. In even more severe cases, operator errors may lead to catastrophic accidents rather than mere malfunctions. Take, for example, a 65-meter aerial work platform used by a fire department: during a training exercise, the driver’s misoperation caused the telescopic boom to extend rapidly at an extremely low angle, resulting in the vehicle tipping over. This incident led to casualties and substantial property damage. The types of failures caused by improper use and maintenance are numerous, and many major accidents actually occur during routine operation and maintenance activities. Therefore, the first priority for organizations using hydraulic equipment should be to provide comprehensive hydraulic technology training for all relevant personnel—both operators and managers. Training should cover not only how to operate the equipment safely but also how to understand its functions, working principles, and key safety precautions. Additionally, strict adherence to operational procedures and guidelines outlined in the equipment’s manual is essential during daily use. Only through proper management, regular maintenance, and conscientious operation can hydraulic systems perform optimally, minimize breakdowns, and ensure reliable, long-term functionality. 4. Causes of Hydraulic Oil Contamination More than 75% of hydraulic system failures are caused by hydraulic oil contamination. In hydraulic systems, the oil tank is often the primary source of fluid contamination. Many tanks suffer from design and manufacturing flaws—most commonly, ""closed"" tank designs that are poorly engineered. For instance, seals are frequently omitted at connections and pipe joints, allowing contaminants to seep into the tank. Once contaminated, the oil circulates through the hydraulic system, accelerating wear, corrosion, and blockages in critical components—and ultimately leading to system failure. In recent years, Chapter 3 has focused extensively on diagnosing and repairing hydraulic system faults. 75 Manufacturers have conducted numerous valuable explorations and practical efforts in optimizing fuel tank structural design to minimize or eliminate contaminants from entering the tank. For instance, the now-common fully enclosed tank design features a single vent hole that remains connected to the atmosphere, while the rest of the tank is completely sealed. All connection points and pipe joints are equipped with rigorously designed sealing mechanisms. Additionally, the fuel filler cap incorporates a filtration system as part of the vent structure—this opening ensures proper communication between the tank’s liquid level and the atmosphere, maintaining optimal system operation while simultaneously preventing external contaminants from infiltrating the tank. Because the tank is entirely sealed, the pump’s suction port no longer requires a filter. Instead, all return oil from the system passes through a central return line filter before being redirected back into the tank, effectively keeping the hydraulic system’s fluid clean at all times. This innovative design not only safeguards the internal oil from external contamination but also significantly reduces suction resistance by eliminating the need for a filter at the pump’s intake. As a result, it helps prevent cavitation—a common issue that can arise when suction resistance is too high. The author encountered this problem firsthand while troubleshooting a shoe-making company’s hydraulic equipment, where the “hydraulic system pressure fluctuated intermittently.” Upon inspection, it was discovered that the oil inside the tank had already been compromised by contaminants. After layering, a clear gel-like substance was observed below 200 mm from the oil surface, while numerous granular sediments had accumulated at the bottom of the tank. Upon removing and inspecting the hydraulic pump’s filter, it became evident that it was almost completely clogged. Clearly, the system failure was caused by contamination of the hydraulic oil. By replacing the filter, changing the hydraulic oil, and thoroughly cleaning the tank, the issue was successfully resolved. Therefore, when handling hydraulic oil, treat it just like human blood—only by maintaining its proper cleanliness can you ensure that the failure rate of the hydraulic system is minimized. 3.1.3 Fault Diagnosis Steps for Hydraulic Systems",text-EN.txt
175,"1) Verify the fault symptoms or signs Given the complexity and subtlety of hydraulic system failures, it is essential to first verify the specific symptoms or signs of the malfunction. This can be done by asking operators and maintenance personnel about recent changes in the machine’s performance, its maintenance history, any specific actions taken after the initial failure signs appeared, and the components that have already been inspected and adjusted. 2) Identify fault diagnosis parameters Hydraulic system failures are all classified as parameter-based faults, and useful fault information is extracted by measuring relevant parameters. Diagnostic parameters for hydraulic systems include system pressure, system flow rate, component temperature rise, component leakage, system vibration and noise, as well as motor speed. When selecting diagnostic parameters, the following principles should be followed: the parameters must exhibit high sensitivity, ease of measurement, and good reproducibility, while also being capable of capturing as much fault-related information as possible. 3) Analyze and determine the possible location and extent of the fault. Analyze the detected results by referring to the hydraulic system schematic, examining both the structural and system principles to ensure accurate fault diagnosis and minimize misdiagnoses. 4) Develop a rational diagnostic process and diagnostic methods Select instruments and meters for diagnostic use The diagnostic instruments and equipment include photoelectric digital tachometers, thermometers, stopwatches, pressure gauges, hydraulic testers, various types of connectors, specialized tools, and more. The selection principle is as follows: First, choose instruments that do not require any disassembly of system components; second, opt for instruments that need to be connected directly into the system; and finally, use hydraulic measuring devices. In cases where the fault is particularly complex, a hydraulic tester can also be used initially for diagnosis. It’s crucial to note that before analyzing and identifying the exact location and extent of the failure, absolutely avoid any unnecessary disassembly, dismantling, or unauthorized adjustments of hydraulic components. Doing so could inadvertently worsen the problem, introduce new issues, or even complicate the original fault further.

177,"1. Sensory Diagnostic Method Sensory diagnosis, also known as preliminary diagnosis, is one of the simplest and most convenient methods for troubleshooting hydraulic systems. This approach relies on the mnemonic ""look, listen, touch, smell, read, ask."" The visual inspection method can be carried out either while the hydraulic equipment is in operation or when it’s idle. (1) Look. Observe the actual operation of the hydraulic system.",text-EN.txt
178,"First, check the speed to see if there are any changes or abnormalities in the movement of the actuator. Second, check the pressure—this refers to the magnitude and changes in pressure at each monitoring point within the hydraulic system. Third, inspect the fluid: Examine the color of the hydraulic oil to assess its level of contamination. Typically, this is done by pouring the working oil into a transparent glass bottle and letting it sit undisturbed for 1 hour before observing. If the hydraulic oil remains clear, transparent, and colorless, it indicates that the oil is free from contamination. If the oil appears cloudy and white, with clarity at the top of the bottle and turbidity at the bottom, it suggests that water has entered and contaminated the oil. Conversely, if the oil is clear at the bottom but cloudy at the top, air has likely mixed in, causing contamination. If the oil turns a mottled, unevenly cloudy reddish-brown hue, it means iron rust and sediment have contaminated the fluid. A deep red or tea-brown color signals that the oil has degraded due to high temperatures and oxidation. If the oil remains transparent but has faded in color, it suggests that an incompatible type of oil has been mixed in—but as long as the viscosity still meets specifications, the oil can still be used. Finally, check whether there’s foam on the oil’s surface, ensure the oil level stays within the prescribed markings on the dipstick, and verify that the oil’s viscosity aligns with  the required standards. Check whether the oil temperature gauge is within the optimal range of 30–50°C, and whether it exceeds the permissible limit set for the specified temperat ure. Also, perform a  ""fourth check "" for leaks—inspect all connection points for any signs of seepage or leakage. Five checks for vibration refer to whether the hydraulic actuator exhibits any bouncing or jerking du ring operation. Sixth, examine the product: Assess the working condition of the actuator, as well as the stability of the hydraulic system's working pressure and flow rate, based o n the quality of the products produced by the hydraulic equipment. First, check the fuel tank to ensure the fluid level meets the required specifications. Observe whether the hydra ulic pump's suction action causes fluctuations in the tank’s liquid level, potentially leading to the suction pipe and filter briefly exposing above the fluid surface. Also, inspec t the tank and return line for any presence of air bubbles. (2) Listen. Normal equipment operation produces sounds with a certain melody and rhythm, maintaining consistent stabilit y.

179,"The patterns of pitch and rhythm variations, as well as the locations where abnormal sounds originate, c an help pinpoint the exact location of the fault and assess the extent of the damage. ① A high-pitched, screeching noise usually indicates air intake; if you hear cavitation sounds , it could mean the oil filter is clogged with contaminants. The hydraulic pump's oil suction pipe is loose, the seal is damaged or missing, or the oil level in the tank is too low . Additionally, factors such as degraded and contaminated hydraulic oil, or reduced foam-breaking performance, may also contribute to the issue. ② A  ""hissing "" or  ""gushing "" sound indicates a significant oil or gas leak at the drain port or leakage point. ③ The  ""嗒嗒 "" sound indicates poor engagement of the solenoid in the AC solenoid valve, possibly due to contaminants like paint flakes blocking the gap between the movable and stationary iron  cores, or perhaps because the push rod is too long. ④ Rough, heavy noise is often caused by overload in the hydraulic pump or hydraulic cylinder. ⑤ The  ""chirping "" or  ""clucking "" sound from the hydraulic pump is often caused by damaged pump bearings, severe wear on the pump shaft, or air being drawn into the system. ⑥ A sharp, short friction sound often i ndicates dry friction between two contacting surfaces—or it could also mean that the area has been strained. Chapter 3: Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Hydraulic Systems 77 ⑦ Th e impact sound is low and muffled, often caused by loose screws inside the hydraulic cylinder or by foreign objects colliding with it. (3) Touch. Gently feel the moving parts that  are permitted to be touched, to assess their operational condition. To check for temperature rise, touch the surfaces of the hydraulic pump, oil tank, and valve components with you r hand. If it feels hot to the touch after just 2 seconds of contact, you should investigate the cause of the excessive heat. Touch for vibration—gently feel the vibration of movin g parts and pipelines. If you detect high-frequency vibrations, check to identify the underlying cause. Three times, while the workbench is moving at low speed under light load, fe el with your hand to check for any crawling motion. Check the tightness by feeling with your hands the stopper, microswitch, and tightening screws, among other components. Five-poi nt touch for wear assessment: Run your fingers over the worn components of hydraulic elements to evaluate the extent of wear, scoring, and damage. If your fingers feel smooth when  touching the surface of the worn part, it indicates abrasive wear; if you notice a sharp, snagging sensation, it suggests adhesive wear. (4) Smell. Use your sense of smell to deter mine if the fluid has developed a foul, rancid odor or if rubber components are emitting a peculiar smell due to overheating. If you detect a  ""burnt "" oil aroma, it could indicate that the hydraulic pump or hydraulic motor is experiencing cavitation—caused by air being drawn into the system—which generates intense heat and subs equently chars the surrounding oil. Additionally, if the hydraulic oil emits a strong, unpleasant stench or an acrid, pungent odor, this signals that the oil has become severely de graded. Pollution—this item can no longer be used. Check the work environment for any unusual odors to determine whether electrical component insulation has burned out, among other  potential issues.",text-EN.txt

(6) Ask. Inquire with the equipment operator to learn about the device's usual operating condition. Ask whether the hydraulic system is functioni ng properly and if the hydraulic pump shows any abnormal signs. Two questions: when to change the hydraulic oil, and whether the filter screen is clean. Was the pressure or speed c ontrol valve adjusted before the accident occurred, and what abnormal symptoms were observed? Four questions: Were the seals or hydraulic components replaced before the accident oc curred? Five questions about abnormal phenomena that occurred in the hydraulic system before and after the accident. Six frequently occurring past failures and their troubleshooting methods. 2. Parameter Measurement Method Whether a hydraulic system functions properly depends critically on whether its two main operational parameters are within the normal range. Specifically, this involves checking wh ether pressure and flow are within normal operating ranges, as well as verifying the status of critical auxiliary parameters such as system temperature and pump unit power. Under s pecific operating conditions, each component of hydraulic equipment typically maintains a stable set of values—meaning that when a hydraulic system is functioning correctly, its ke y operating parameters should remain close to their expected, condition-specific values. If the actual operating parameters of the hydraulic system deviate from these normal values  or show unusual fluctuations, it indicates that one or more components within the system may have malfunctioned. To diagnose the issue, simply measure the relevant operating param eters at designated monitoring points—such as temperature, pressure, flow rate, leakage, and power—and compare them against the system’s established normal operating values. This c omparison will help determine whether the system is running properly, identify any potential faults, and pinpoint the exact location of the problem. To reduce the workload of disas sembly and assembly, and to ensure testing under conditions as close as possible to the actual operating state of the hydraulic system, the test circuit is typically connected in p arallel with the system being tested. For complex and precision hydraulic equipment, the test instrument can also analyze non-electrical physical parameters—such as pressure, flow  rate, and temperature—obtained during testing. These physical quantities are first converted into electrical signals, which are then processed by a data management system for ampli fication, conversion, and display. As a result, the measured parameters are represented and displayed as electrical signals, allowing operators to compare them against the system’s  normal operational values and determine whether the system is functioning properly. This type of testing proves highly effective for condition monitoring and diagnostics of hydrau lic systems, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of both the entire hydraulic system and its individual components based on their key performance metrics. After identifying the app roximate location of the hydraulic system fault through systematic analysis, proceed to use a testing instrument for further inspection. Measure to narrow down the scope of the sys tem fault to the smallest possible area, allowing you to quickly pinpoint the fault's location.

181,"78 During measurement, no need to shut down the equipment—this allows not only diagnosis of existing faults but also enables online monitoring and prediction of potential failures. Importantly, both prediction and diagnosis are quantitative, significantly enhancing the speed and accuracy of fault detection. For simpler hydraulic systems, this detection method can even bypass the need for sensors altogether, offering rapid testing with minimal error, while the compact and straightforward equipment makes it easy to implement directly in production environments. 3. Comparative Replacement Check Method This is an effective method for diagnosing hydraulic system faults when testing instruments are unavailable, and it’s sometimes best combined with the replacement method. One approach involves conducting a comparative test using two machines of identical make and performance specifications to pinpoint the issue. During the test, suspected components can be temporarily replaced with either new parts or known-good components, then retested. If the machine’s performance improves after the swap, the fault has been identified; if not, the process continues—either by repeating the same method or exploring other potential causes. Another scenario arises in today’s large and medium-sized machinery, where many hydraulic systems feature dual-pump or multi-pump, dual-circuit designs. For such systems, the compa rative replacement method becomes even more convenient. Moreover, modern systems often rely on high-pressure flexible hoses for connectivity, further simplifying the implementation  of the replacement technique. When troubleshooting a suspect component, you can replace it with a functioning part from another circuit without disassembling the original componen t—simply by swapping the corresponding hose fittings instead. For instance, while inspecting a dual-circuit system excavator, if one circuit exhibits weak performance and the hydra ulic pump is suspected of malfunctioning, the technician might proceed as follows: Afterward, manually test the suction at the oil inlet—it feels significantly weaker compared to t he hydraulic pump in the other circuit. This suggests possible severe wear, due to…",text-EN.txt

Logical Diagnostic Method The logical diagnostic method involves dividing the  system into multiple functional units for analysis, gradually narrowing down to the specific area where the fault occurs, ultimately identifying the root cause of the problem, and  then proceeding with repairs.

192,"80 For more complex hydraulic systems, it is typically advisable to analyze them separately into two main components: the working oil circuit and the control oil circuit. The analysis method for each component remains the same as described above. In particular, for pilot-operated hydraulic systems—where the control oil circuit tends to be more intricate and thus more prone to failures—it’s especially important to conduct thorough inspections and detailed analyses. 3.1.5 Common Hydraulic System Faults and Maintenance",text-EN.txt
193,"Hydraulic System Vibration and Noise Fault Diagnosis and Repair Vibration and noise in hydraulic systems primarily originate from two sources: mechanical vibration and noise, as well as fluid-induced vibration and noise. These vibrations and noises not only reduce equipment efficiency and production quality but can, in severe cases, lead to equipment damage, impairing the overall performance of the hydraulic system and shortening the service life of hydraulic components. Therefore, identifying the root causes of vibration and noise and implementing effective measures to mitigate their harmful effects are critical issues that must be addressed and resolved in the operation and maintenance of hydraulic systems. Causes of mechanical vibration (1) Imbalance in rotating components. When motors, hydraulic pumps, and hydraulic motors—components commonly found in hydraulic systems—operate at high speeds, any imbalance in their rotating parts generates periodic unbalanced centrifugal forces. These forces can lead to bending vibrations in the shafts, resulting in noise. Moreover, when these vibrations are transmitted through mounting bases or piping systems to the oil tank, other pipelines, or integrated blocks, they cause additional vibrations in these components, further amplifying the noise. Additionally, motors may also produce vibrations caused by ventilation (such as those from fans) as well as electromagnetic vibrations. (2) Vibration and Noise Caused by Couplings. The coupling is the primary mechanical connection component in a hydraulic system. If an inappropriate coupling is selected, it can generate significant vibrations. The drive shaft of the hydraulic pump cannot withstand radial or axial forces; therefore, it is not permitted to directly mount pulleys, gears, or sprockets onto the shaft ends. Instead, couplings are typically used to connect the drive shaft to the pump’s transmission shaft. In cases where manufacturing issues arise, the pump and… When the coupling's coaxiality significantly differs and there are assembly misalignments, the increasing centrifugal force at higher pump speeds causes the coupling to deform. This deformation, in turn, further amplifies the centrifugal force, creating a vicious cycle that ultimately leads to vibration—and consequently shortens the pump's service life. Additionally, factors such as loose coupling pins that aren’t tightened promptly, or worn-out rubber rings that aren’t replaced in time, can also contribute to vibrations and noise. (3) Piping, valves, and the oil tank. The piping itself is not a vibration source; rather, its vibrations are induced by the oscillations of other components. When the natural frequency of the piping matches the frequency of the vibration source, resonance occurs in the pipe, which can also trigger vibrations in adjacent components. Meanwhile, the oil tank itself generates vibrations as well. However, since the hydraulic pump and electric motor are directly mounted on the tank, their vibrations cause the tank to resonate, amplifying the overall vibration even further. Additionally, these vibrations may lead to turbulence within the oil tank, resulting in further oscillations of the hydraulic fluid. 2) Causes of Fluid Vibration (1) Fluid vibration caused by the inherent flow pulsation of the hydraulic pump itself. In hydraulic systems, the hydraulic pump is the primary source of vibration, accounting for approximately 75% of the total system’s vibrational noise. Therefore, reducing the vibration of the hydraulic pump is a critical measure for improving product performance. Hydraulic pump flow pulsation is an intrinsic characteristic of the pump—particularly in axial piston pumps, where multiple pistons operate simultaneously, creating distinct oil-discharge and oil-suction chambers. As a result, the pump’s instantaneous flow rate at any given moment equals the sum of the instantaneous flows from all pistons currently in the discharge chamber. In other words, the output flow of an axial piston pump is essentially the superposition of individual sinusoidal flow patterns generated by each piston. For axial piston pumps, flow pulsation is directly tied to the pump’s operational design. Inherent characteristics of plunger pumps: Hydraulic pumps with different numbers of plungers all exhibit corresponding inherent flow pulsations. These flow pulsations from the hydraulic pump inevitably lead to pressure fluctuations at the pump outlet and in the associated piping, which then propagate throughout the entire system, generating fluid noise. (2) Vibration and noise caused by directional valve shifting. In hydraulic systems, when the load inertia is relatively high, a sudden change in the direction of the directional valve causes an abrupt shift in the flow velocity of the fluid moving through the pipeline. At this instant, the conversion of the fluid's kinetic energy generates pressure surges, leading to vibration and noise. Additionally, if an electro-magnetic directional valve switches rapidly, the oil circuit may shut off abruptly— Chapter 3: Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Hydraulic Systems",text-EN.txt
194,"81 Hydraulic shocks can occur due to sudden changes in fluid direction or when a relief valve suddenly opens, causing the hydraulic pump to unload. These hydraulic shocks not only  lead to significant vibrations and noise but can also cause severe damage to the hydraulic system if the pressure spikes become excessively high. (3) Vibration and Noise Caused by  Cavitation. Hydraulic oil typically contains 2% to 5% air, making cavitation a common occurrence during hydraulic system operation. Once cavitation occurs, the resulting bubbles tr avel with the oil toward areas of higher pressure, where they collapse under the intense pressure, generating significant pressure fluctuations. These fluctuations lead to system v ibrations and produce noticeable noise. (4) Turbulence and Vortices. Within the fluid flow passages of a hydraulic system, changes in the cross-sectional area or flow direction cau se corresponding variations in flow velocity and pressure. When these changes occur abruptly, turbulence and vortex phenomena arise. Such turbulence and vortices significantly incr ease the interaction between the fluid and the pipe walls—or the pump and valve body surfaces—leading to vibrations and noise. 3) Measures to Reduce Vibration and Noise in Hydrauli c Systems",text-EN.txt
195,"(1) The design incorporates low-noise motors, low-noise pumps, and components, along with elastic couplings, to reduce the pump's rotational speed. (2) Adopt an overhead  fuel tank to improve pump oil suction resistance, eliminate system air, install a pressure-relief circuit, extend the valve's directional switching time, equip the spool with a buf fered taper or grooves, and incorporate filters while increasing pipe diameters. (3) Use accumulators and rubber hoses to reduce vibrations caused by pressure pulsations. The accum ulator can absorb noise below 10 Hz, while high-frequency noise is effectively dampened by hydraulic hoses. (4) Use a vertical motor to submerge the hydraulic pump in the oil, redu cing gas noise. (5) Whenever possible, replace piping with hydraulic manifold blocks to minimize vibration. (6) Use a balanced motor rotor, and install vibration-damping pads on th e mounting surfaces of the motor, hydraulic pump, and hydraulic valves. Maintenance can be performed by replacing motor bearings or using other appropriate methods. (7) Covering th e hydraulic pump with a soundproof enclosure lined with sound-absorbing materials can effectively reduce noise. (8) Select appropriate pipe clamps, ensuring proper installation spa cing and securing strength. (9) Ensure proper concentricity when installing the hydraulic pump and motor coupling. (10) Isolate from or eliminate external vibration sources, and in crease the stiffness of connecting components to external loads. (11) At the oil outlet convergence point of the two pumps, turbulence often occurs. To mitigate this, slightly sepa rate the two pump outlets before they merge. Additionally, ensure that when the oils converge, their flow directions do not oppose each other directly—but instead form an angle les s than 90°.

Fault Diagnosis and Repair of Hydraulic System Pressure Control Issues Pressure loss in hydraulic transmission systems is the most common failure, typically manifesting as no system pressure, inability to adjust pressure, pressure fluctuations, or uncontrolled unloading. 1) ""System Stress-Free"" Fault Diagnosis and Repair (1) During operation, the system suddenly dropped to zero pressure and became unresponsive to adjustments. This type of failure is most often caused by issues within the pressure regulation system itself. Possible reasons include: the damping orifice of the relief valve being blocked; foreign particles on the sealing surface of the relief valve; the main spool of the relief valve becoming stuck in the open position; the solenoid in the unloading directional control valve burning out, the wiring breaking, or the electrical signal failing to activate; and, in the case of proportional relief valves, the electric control signal may have been interrupted altogether. Maintenance methods: Clean or replace the overflow valve; inspect or replace the unloading directional control valve; inspect or replace the proportional overflow valve. (2) After the equipment has been shut down for a period of time and is restarted, the pressure reads zero. Possible causes for this failure include: the overflow valve being rusted in the open position; the hydraulic pump motor rotating in reverse; and issues with the hydraulic pump, as discussed in the case studies on diagnosing and repairing electromechanical system failures.",text-EN.txt
197,"82 The oil filter is clogged, or the suction pipe has an air leak, preventing oil from being drawn up. Maintenance methods: Clean or replace the overflow valve; inspect and repair the motor wiring; check the oil filter and suction pipe. (3) After equipment components were inspected, disassembled, and replaced, the pressure dropped to zero. Possible causes of this failure include: the hydraulic pump not being securely tightened, preventing it from creating a working volume; insufficient oil in the pump, which prevents the formation of a sealing oil film; and the spool of the directional control valve being installed backward—particularly if the system uses an M-type valve with a mid-position, as reversing its installation will cause the system to lose pressure. Maintenance methods: Tighten or inspect the hydraulic pump; properly install the spool of the directional control valve. 2) Fault Diagnosis and Repair for ""System Pressure Fails to Rise High and Adjustment Is Ineffective"" This failure is typically caused by internal leakage, with the main reasons as follows: (1) The hydraulic pump wears out, creating clearances that prevent the system pressure from rising, while also causing the output flow to decrease. (2) Wear on the main spool and mating surfaces of the relief valve causes a drop in the control pressure of the relief valve, leading to a decrease in system pressure. (3) Wear in the hydraulic cylinder or hydraulic motor, or damage to the seals, causes the system to drop pressure or fail to maintain its original pressure—provided that The system contains multiple actuators; if the operating pressure of one actuator is abnormal while the pressures of the other actuators remain normal, it indicates that this particular actuator is faulty. (4) Gaps in valves and valve plates within the system can lead to leaks, which also cause a drop in system pressure. The repair method is as follows. (1) Inspect or replace the hydraulic pump.

202,"3. Hydraulic System Temperature Rise Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance Typically, the normal operating temperature for hydraulic systems is between 40 and 60°C; exceeding 60°C can negatively impact the system. Causes of overheating failures in hydraulic systems Hydraulic systems frequently experience overheating during operation. Analysis reveals that the main causes of overheating are as follows: In various aspects.",text-EN.txt
203,"(1) The hydraulic system design is unreasonable. ① The hydraulic system's oil tank has been designed with too small a capacity and insufficient heat dissipation area, and no coolin g device has been incorporated—or if one is present, its capacity is inadequate. ② The selected valve components are undersized, leading to excessively high oil flow velocities thr ough the valves and increased pressure losses, which in turn cause overheating. For instance, if an overflow valve is too small, or if the directional control valve in a differenti al circuit is sized solely based on the pump’s flow rate, this issue can occur. ③ In quantitative pump systems where the hydraulic pump capacity is chosen according to the fast-forward speed, most of the excess flow will typically bypass through the overflow  valve at high pressure (the system’s working pressure), resulting in heat generation during operation. ④ The system is not designed with an unloading circuit, so the hydraulic pump  does not unload when operation stops. As a result, the pump’s entire flow rate overflows under high pressure, leading to overflow losses and heat generation, which causes the temp erature to rise. ⑤ Excessive back pressure in the hydraulic system. For instance, in circuits using electro-hydraulic directional control valves, a certain level of back pressure m ust be maintained in the system even when the valve is not actuated (in the neutral position) to ensure reliable valve switching. However, if the system flow rate is high, this exc ess flow will bypass through the relief valve as control pressure, leading to overheating. ⑥ The system piping is too narrow and long, features numerous bends, and experiences freq uent cross-sectional changes, leading to significant local pressure losses as well as substantial frictional pressure losses along the pipe length, ultimately resulting in low syst em efficiency. (2) Poor manufacturing quality. Hydraulic components suffer from inadequate machining precision and assembly quality, leading to significant mechanical friction loss es between moving parts. Additionally, excessive clearance between mating components results in high internal and external leakage, causing substantial volumetric losses and rapid  temperature rise. (3) The system is severely worn. Many key components in the hydraulic system rely on clearance sealing, such as the gears in gear pumps paired with the pump housi ng and side plates, the cylinder block and swashplate in piston pumps and motors, the cylinder bore fitting tightly around the pistons, the spool and valve body in directional cont rol valves, and the slide spools and valve sleeves/valve bodies in other types of valves. Once wear increases in these hydraulic components, it can lead to internal leakage. Leakag e increases, leading to a rise in temperature, which in turn reduces the viscosity of the hydraulic oil. This, in turn, causes further internal leakage, ultimately resulting in hig her oil temperatures. One step higher. (4) Improper use of system oil. Hydraulic oil is a critical medium for maintaining the system's proper operation, and preserving its high qua lity is essential to ensuring optimal transmission performance and efficiency. If hydraulic oil with either excessively high or low viscosity is mistakenly used, it can lead to pre mature degradation of the oil, resulting in wear of moving components and subsequent overheating. (5) Improper system debugging. System pressure is regulated by a safety valve; how ever, if the safety valve is set to a pressure that’s either too high or too low, it can lead to increased system heating. For instance, if the safety valve is set too low, the hyd raulic cylinder won’t be able to overcome the external load when the load increases, causing it to stall. In this situation, the safety valve opens, allowing a large volume of oil  to flow back into the reservoir. Conversely, if the safety valve is set too high, it will cause the hydraulic oil to flow through the valve at an accelerated rate, increasing the f low and, consequently, generating more heat within the system.

205,"Additionally, during manufacturing and operation, improper system adjustments—particularly when valve co mponents are not properly calibrated—can result in the valve stem failing to reach the set opening level, which in turn may cause the system temperature to rise. (6) Improper opera tion practices. These issues primarily arise when operators perform actions too quickly or forcefully, leading to hydraulic shock within the system. For instance, frequently moving  hydraulic cylinders to their limit positions while delaying the directional change can cause such shocks. Similarly, keeping valve spools partially open for extended periods may r esult in throttling, while system overloading—causing the relief valve to remain open continuously—can lead to mismatched on-off characteristics that don’t meet operational require ments. Additionally, excessive pressure drops can also contribute to system overheating. (7) Insufficient cooling in the hydraulic system. ① If the hydraulic system radiator and oi l tank are covered with dust, sludge, or other contaminants without being cleaned, an insulating layer will form, reducing the heat transfer coefficient or decreasing the heat diss ipation area, thereby affecting the overall cooling performance of the system. ② The exhaust fan speed is too low, resulting in insufficient airflow. ③ Hydraulic oil circuit blocka ge (e.g., the return line and cooler becoming clogged due to contaminants and impurities, leading to increased back pressure, and triggering the bypass valve) When opened, the hydr aulic oil flows directly to the tank without passing through the cooler, resulting in insufficient system cooling. ④ Prolonged continuous operation in an environment with excessive ly high temperatures will cause the hydraulic system to heat up; alternatively, if the operating environment differs significantly from the original equipment’s intended temperatur e range, it can also lead to inadequate cooling of the system. 2) Hydraulic System Overheating Failure Repair Methods To ensure the proper functioning of the hydraulic system, it i s essential to keep the system temperature within the normal range. If the hydraulic system overheats, first identify the underlying cause before implementing the appropriate and t argeted corrective measures. (1) Select hydraulic oil according to the instructions in the hydraulic system manual, ensuring the oil remains clean to prevent filter clogging. Addit ionally, regularly check the oil level to maintain an adequate supply of hydraulic fluid. (2) Regularly inspect and maintain wear-prone components to prevent leaks caused by severe  wear. Hydraulic pumps, electric motors, and areas with mating clearances are particularly susceptible to leakage due to wear, which can also lead to reduced volumetric efficiency  and accelerated system heating. Therefore, schedule routine inspections and promptly replace any damaged components to minimize volume losses and effectively prevent leaks. (3) Str ictly adjust the system pressure according to the instructions in the user manual, avoiding excessive pressure and ensuring that safety valves, overload valves, and other component s operate under normal conditions. (4) Regularly clean the radiator and fuel tank surfaces to keep them free of dirt and debris, ensuring efficient heat dissipation. (5) Operate an d use equipment properly—avoid making movements too fast or abrupt during operation. Whenever possible, do not leave the valve stem in a partially open position to prevent prolonge d overflow of high-pressure hydraulic oil under pressure, thereby minimizing heat generation due to throttling. (6) Regularly check the rotational speed of the power source and the  tension of the fan belt to ensure the fan maintains adequate speed and sufficient cooling capacity. (7) Ensure that the actual operating temperature of the hydraulic system matche s its designed allowable operating temperature range. (8) System overheating issues caused by unreasonable design should be addressed by improving the system through technological  innovations, modifications, or redesigns. 4. Speed Control System Fault Diagnosis and Repair The speed instability in hydraulic systems primarily manifests as creeping, inability t o adjust speed, unstable speed, and slow response. ""Crawling"" Fault Diagnosis and Repair Crawling is a jerky, intermittent motion phenomenon that occurs when hydraulic systems operate at low speeds—it’s one of the more common issues in hydraulic systems.

215,"5. Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Pressure Surges in Hydraulic Systems Hydraulic shock is one of the common failures. In hydraulic transmission systems, the pressure of the fluid inside the system can suddenly fluctuate at a specific moment due to rapid directional changes or the abrupt opening or closing of valve ports. 1) Causes of hydraulic shock (1) Sudden closure or opening of a valve. When a liquid flows through a pipe, if the valve is closed abruptly, the flow velocity instantly drops to zero. At this moment, the liquid's kinetic energy is converted into pressure energy, causing a sudden increase in fluid pressure and generating a pressure shock wave. Conversely, when the valve opens suddenly, a drop in pressure occurs instead. (2) Inertial forces of actuators. The inertial forces generated by high-speed hydraulic actuators can also cause hydraulic shocks within the system. For instance, when industrial robotic arms or the slewing motors of hydraulic excavator turntables brake or reverse direction—resulting in the sudden closure of the oil discharge lines—the rotating mechanisms, still moving due to inertia, continue to spin, leading to a sharp increase in pressure and triggering a hydraulic shock. (3) Components exhibit sluggish response actions. In hydraulic systems, certain components’ delayed or unresponsive behavior can also lead to hydraulic shocks. For instance, a pressure-limiting variable hydraulic pump may fail to promptly reduce its displacement when pressure rises, resulting in pressure surges. Similarly, if the relief valve cannot open quickly enough, it may cause excessive pressure overshoot, both of which can trigger pressure shocks. 2) Troubleshooting Hydraulic Shock Faults (1) Maximize the time required for valve closure and braking/reversing of moving components. If the braking/reversing time of moving parts can exceed 0.2 seconds, the resulting imp act will be significantly reduced. This can be achieved in hydraulic systems by using directional control valves with adjustable switching times. For instance, employing electro-hy draulic directional valves or valves equipped with tapered shoulder spools allows precise control over the movement speed of the main spool, thereby enabling fine-tuning of the swi tching time. (2) Properly design valve ports. Limit pipeline flow velocity and the speed of moving components to ensure smoother deceleration during braking. For instance, in machi ne tool hydraulic systems, pipeline flow velocities are typically restricted to below 4.5 m/s, while the speed of hydraulically driven moving parts should generally not exceed 10 m /min. Alternatively, reduce the fluid flow rate gradually before the spool valve fully closes—for example, by modifying the structure of the spool’s control edges, such as cutting  rectangular or V-shaped straight grooves along the edges of the spool’s land, or shaping the edges into a conical throttling surface. Compared to right-angled control edges, these  designs significantly minimize hydraulic shock. In external cylindrical grinders, a pre-braking mechanism is applied to the pilot directional control valve, followed by a rapid jum p of the main directional control valve to its mid-position, instantly supplying pressurized oil to both chambers of the worktable cylinder (with the main valve configured in a P-s hape). This approach ensures smooth and controlled movement of the worktable. 87 Smooth, impact-free stopping. The directional control valve in the closed-loop travel circuit can b e designed with an H-port configuration, ensuring that when the valve rapidly shifts to its neutral position, both chambers of the motor are interconnected and connected to the oil  tank—thereby reducing shock pressure during braking. (3) Appropriately increase the pipe diameter and minimize the pipeline length as much as possible. Enlarging the pipe diameter  not only helps reduce flow velocity but also decreases the speed of pressure shock waves. Shortening the pipeline length aims to minimize the propagation time of pressure shock wa ves; if necessary, relief valves can be installed near the shock zone, along with accumulators or other buffering devices, to achieve this goal. Accumulators not only reduce the di stance over which pressure waves travel, thereby cutting down the corresponding propagation time, but also effectively absorb the impact pressure itself. (4) Install a cushioning d evice at the end of the hydraulic cylinder. Control the oil discharge rate at the cylinder’s end (e.g., using a unidirectional throttle valve) to ensure smooth, impact-free deceler ation as the cylinder reaches its stop position. In some machine tools where high precision is not critical, it’s also possible to connect both chambers of the hydraulic cylinder d irectly.",text-EN.txt

It occurs during low-speed operation of hydraulic cylinders or hydraulic motors, resulting in an intermittent, uneven motion characterized by alternating jerks—where the piston rod or motor rotor suddenly jumps forward followed by brief pauses—and unstable, fluctuating movement of the pressure gauge needle. 1) Causes and Maintenance of Crawling Faults Caused by Hydraulic Cylinder Binding",text-EN.txt
226,"(1) Cause of the failure. When a hydraulic cylinder is in motion, it must overcome not only the resistance required to move the load but also the internal friction within the cylinder itself. If the internal friction resistance becomes excessively high, it indicates that the hydraulic cylinder is experiencing binding. Because binding occurs during cylinder operation, this makes the topic particularly relevant for the ""Case Studies in Diagnostics and Maintenance of Mechatronic Systems"" tutorial. 88",text-EN.txt
227,Most prone to vibration and exhibiting crawling behavior.,text-EN.txt
228,"(2) Fault Diagnosis and Repair. ① Improper assembly. Without applying load to the hydraulic cylinder, measure its minimum operating resistance. If the resistance is excessively high, it indicates the presence of binding. Such binding typically arises from incorrect hydraulic cylinder assembly practices. Therefore, during the assembly process, strictly follow the specified assembly procedures to ensure that the piston and piston rod move freely without being subjected to lateral forces or torsional stresses. Additionally, verify that the sealing elements maintain appropriate resistance levels and are in optimal condition. ② The reaction force from the load causes the hydraulic cylinder to become skewed. This binding phenomenon in the hydraulic cylinder, resulting from the applied load force, typically becomes noticeable only when the cylinder is pushing the load into motion. For instance, a hydraulic cylinder equipped with base mounts may experience insufficient rigidity in its feet; as a result, when the cylinder moves the load, the reaction force from the load induces flexible deformation in the foot mounts, leading to skewing of the cylinder and the onset of binding. Therefore, during installation, hydraulic cylinders must not only maintain adequate positional accuracy but also ensure sufficient structural rigidity. 2) Causes of Creep Failure Due to Seals and Maintenance Measures Hydraulic cylinders are significantly affected by seal rings when it comes to the phenomenon of creep. In most cases, the first step should be to check whether the piston rod support seals and piston seals are tightened too much. If creep occurs when the hydraulic cylinder's movement speed drops below 5 mm/s, no other solutions will work effectively. When selecting seals, care should be taken to ensure proper performance. To eliminate creeping, the seal material must have a minimal difference between its dynamic and static friction coefficients. Additionally, the sealing design itself should minimize resistance while maximizing rigidity; after being subjected to tensile forces, it should exhibit low elongation. Ideally, the sealing material would possess negative friction characteristics—meaning that as sliding speed increases, so does the resistance. For instance, seals made from leather or polytetrafluoroethylene are well-suited for low-speed applications in hydraulic cylinders. However, V-shaped seals containing only nitrile rubber are not recommended for use in low-speed scenarios. 3) Causes and Maintenance of Crawling Faults Caused by Hydraulic Component Wear",text-EN.txt
229,"(1) Wear of internal pump components. Wear increases clearances, leading to insufficient or fluctuating flow and pressure output from the hydraulic pump. When moving parts operate at low speeds, variations in their resistance—combined with the pump's inability to adjust pressure—inevitably result in creeping motion. (2) Wear of valve components and hydraulic cylinders. As wear increases the clearance between parts, it allows communication between the high-pressure and low-pressure chambers, leading to insufficient pressure. Consequently, under varying external frictional resistance, creeping motion is bound to occur even during low-speed operation. Component wear issues are categorized into two types: normal wear and abnormal wear. Normal wear can typically be addressed by repairing or replacing the affected parts, while in cases of abnormal wear, it’s crucial to identify the root cause and implement appropriate corrective measures. 4) Causes and Maintenance of Creeping Failures Caused by Working Medium Contamination",text-EN.txt

In particular, hydraulic servo systems require multiple cleaning cycles to ensure optimal cleanliness. Additionally, air vents on the reservoir must be fitted with air filt ers, and oil should be added via an oil filtration vehicle.

When the two gears of the pump rotate in the direction indicated, the oil suction chamber at the bottom gradually expands as the meshing teeth progressively disengage, creating a partial vacuum. Meanwhile, oil from the reservoir flows into this expanding space. Under the action of atmospheric pressure, oil enters the suction chamber via the suction pipe, completely filling the inter-tooth spaces. As the gears rotate, the oil is carried upward into the pressurized oil chamber. Due to the gradual engagement of the meshing gears, the volume of the pressurized chamber continuously decreases, forcing the oil outward and delivering it into the pressure pipeline. Throughout the operation of the gear pump, as long as the rotational direction of the two gears remains unchanged, the positions of the suction and pressurized chambers will also stay fixed. Unchanging. The tooth contact line at the meshing point continuously separates the high- and low-pressure chambers, simultaneously performing oil distribution. As a result, gear pumps do not require a dedicated distribution mechanism—this is what sets them apart from other types of positive-displacement hydraulic pumps.

241,"2. Gear Pump Disassembly, Assembly, and Usage Notes Disassembly and Assembly of Gear Pumps Proper disassembly and assembly of gear pumps are fundamental to troubleshooting and repairing gear pump failures. The steps for disassembling and assembling a gear pump are as follows: (1) Use an Allen wrench to loosen the 6 Allen screws, then use a pin extractor to remove the two pins. (2) Remove the back cover, then take out the needle roller bearing and place it in the pre-prepared kerosene. (3) Remove the pump body, and use an external cylindrical spring caliper to take out the two spring retaining rings—one on the long shaft and one on the short shaft. (4) Lay the front cover flat (using two parallel shims placed beneath it to prevent the long shaft from resting directly on the workbench surface), and refer to the mobile phone electrical system fault diagnosis and repair case study tutorial. 92 Gently tap out the long and short shafts using a hammer and copper rod, then carefully remove both gears along with the respective long and short shafts. Finally, dismantle the sealing ring, completing the entire disassembly process. (5) After all disassembled parts have been cleaned with kerosene, replace or repair any damaged or wear-prone components (such as sealing rings), then reassemble them in the reverse order of disassembly. 2) Precautions for Using Gear Pumps Gear pumps are widely used as the pressure source in hydraulic systems for vehicles and mobile equipment, thanks to their simple design, compact size, lightweight construction (mos t gear pumps feature aluminum alloy pump bodies), strong self-priming capability, excellent contamination resistance, and ease of maintenance and inspection. (1) Preparations befor e installation: Before installing the pump, fill it completely with hydraulic oil and rotate the drive gear to ensure oil reaches all mating surfaces. Verify that the pump’s rotati on direction matches that of the drive shaft. Thoroughly clean the pipelines according to relevant regulations (welded pipes must undergo pickling followed by rinsing) to remove de bris, scale, and other contaminants. (2) Drive Method: Gear pumps can be powered by either an electric motor or an internal combustion engine as the prime mover. However, the pump’ s transmission system must not impose additional axial or radial forces on the gear pump’s driving gear. The connection between the pump shaft extension and the prime mover shaft e xtension should utilize a floating coupling; flexible couplings and cross-slide couplings are recommended. The radial runout of the coupling should not exceed 0.1 mm. In cases wher e structural constraints necessitate directly inserting the splined shaft into the corresponding spline bore of the prime mover’s drive shaft for direct power transmission, the rad ial clearance between the internal splines and the splined shaft, as well as the lateral clearance of the key, must both be at least 0.15 mm to ensure proper torque transfer via fl oating action and to prevent the generation of unwanted radial internal forces. Generally, belt and drive gears are not used to directly power gear pumps. However, if structural co nstraints absolutely require it, radial support should be added, or hydraulic pump products with end covers equipped with radially supported bearings should be selected. (3) Suctio n height. The pump's suction height should be as low as possible. The pump's self-priming capability varies depending on its displacement, but generally, it should not fall below 1 6 kPa. Typically, the pump's suction height is required to be no more than 0.5 meters; however, in piping systems with longer inlet lines, the diameter of the inlet pipe should be  increased to prevent excessive flow resistance, which could lead to poor oil intake and negatively impact the pump's performance. (4) Selection and Filtration of Hydraulic Fluid. T he working fluid should be selected strictly according to the specifications provided in the pump’s product manual, as this will help extend the pump’s service life. In many cases,  early failures of gear pumps are caused by fluid contamination; therefore, it’s essential to filter the working oil. Since low-pressure gear pumps exhibit lower sensitivity to con tamination, filters with relatively lower filtration accuracy can be used. However, high-pressure gear pumps are more susceptible to contamination, so systems should incorporate fi lters with higher filtration precision. (5) Operation. Before starting the hydraulic pump, check that the pipe fittings or flange connection screws at the inlet and outlet ports ar e securely tightened and that the seals are reliable. Also, verify whether the safety valve in the system is set to the correct pressure setting. Finally, perform a jog test to con firm that the pump is rotating in the correct direction. During operation, slightly loosen the outlet connection to bleed out any air. Avoid starting the pump under load, as well a s stopping it while it’s still under load. The pump should undergo at least 10 minutes of no-load operation and a short period of loaded operation before starting work, followed by  a check of the pump's performance. Under no circumstances should the pump exhibit leaks, excessive heating, or unusual noises. If the pump is not used for an extended period, it’s  best to store it separately from the prime mover. When resuming use, allow the pump to run at no load for at least 10 minutes, followed by the routine inspection procedures outlin ed above. 3. Common Faults and Maintenance of Gear Pumps As usage time increases, the volumetric efficiency of gear pumps declines, and in severe cases, they may even fail to opera te properly. The primary cause is surface wear resulting from the relative sliding motion between rotating components like gears and drive shafts, as well as other mating parts. Th e main areas where wear occurs in gear pumps include the interaction between the drive shaft and its bushing (or needle bearings), the contact between the pump housing cavity and t he outer surfaces of the gears, and the interface between the gear end faces and the pump cover. When wear becomes significant enough to cause the pump’s key performance indicators  to fall below specifications, the pump should be disassembled to identify the specific wear locations and extent, followed by implementing appropriate repair measures. Common faul ts, their causes, and repair methods for gear pumps are shown in Table 3.3. Chapter 3: Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Hydraulic Systems",text-EN.txt

256,"The repair methods for the main components of the seal ring gear pump  are as follows. (1) Measures to address gear surface wear. Gear oil pumps typically rotate in one direction only, causing wear to occur on just one side of the gear teeth. To rest ore performance, you can remove burrs from the worn gear teeth using an oilstone, thoroughly clean the gears, and then reposition them so that the previously non-meshing tooth surf aces now engage properly with each other. This simple adjustment effectively revives the pump’s operational efficiency. (2) End-face Repair: The gear end faces wear down due to rel ative rotation against the bearing housing or front/rear covers. In mild cases, this results in scoring, which can be removed and polished using a grinding method. However, if the  wear is severe, the gears should be resurfaced on a surface grinder. Note:  Both gears must be ground simultaneously on the surface grinder to ensure that the thickness difference between them remains within 0.005 mm. Additionally, it’s crucial to maintai n both the perpendicularity of the end faces to the gear bore axis and the parallelism of the two end faces—both within 0.005 mm. After grinding, use an oilstone to round off any s harp edges, but  never chamfer  them. The goal is simply to eliminate burrs and flash, leaving the surfaces smooth and free of imperfections. (3) Repair of pump shafts (long and short shafts). The wear typically  occurs on the outer surface of the shaft where it contacts the needle roller bearings (in gear pumps using a needle roller bearing design with a fixed end clearance) or on the out er surface that mates with the floating bushing (in gear pumps featuring a floating bushing design offering automatic end-clearance compensation). When the pump shaft shows minor w ear, polishing can be used for repair, accompanied by replacing the needle roller bearings or bushings. However, if the wear is severe and the clearance exceeds acceptable limits s ignificantly, not only should the needle roller bearings or bushings be replaced, but the drive shaft itself must also undergo either chrome plating or buildup welding to increase  its diameter—followed by grinding back to the standard size—or, alternatively, the shaft may need to be re-machined entirely to replace it with a new one. (4) Bearing Race Repair.  Wear on the bearing race typically occurs at the inner bore where it contacts the gear. If the end faces are worn or exhibit burrs and scoring, the four bearing races can be placed  on a surface grinder, using the end face that does not contact the gear as a reference. Grind the scored end faces flat in a single operation, ensuring the final precision remains  within a tolerance of 0.01 mm. Generally, bearing races experience minimal wear; however, if wear is severe, they can be lapped, or the bore diameter can be slightly enlarged foll owed by the reselection of appropriate needle rollers. Alternatively, the bearing races may need to be replaced entirely. (5) Pump body maintenance. Pump body wear typically occurs  in the suction chamber. For symmetrical gear pumps, simply flipping the pump body 180° will convert the suction chamber into a pressure chamber, restoring its operational capabili ty. In the case of asymmetrical pump designs, repair can be achieved through electroplating with a bronze alloy or by brush plating; alternatively, a copper sleeve insertion method  can also be used for restoration.

257,"Structure and Working Principle of Vane Pumps As shown in Figure 3.6, this is a diagram illustrating the structure and operating principle of the YB1 vane pump. It primarily consists of a drive shaft, stator, rotor, and... It consists of components such as the vanes, pump body, and pump cover. The stator, rotor, vanes, and distribution plate can first be assembled into a single integrated unit before being installed inside the front and rear covers. The inner surface of the stator is approximately elliptical, with the rotor mounted concentrically inside the stator. Two suction zones and two pressure zones are arranged symmetrically, ensuring that the suction and pressure areas experience balanced hydraulic forces. As the rotor rotates, the vanes extend outward due to centrifugal force and the hydraulic pressure at their roots, maintaining close contact with the inner surface of the stator. This creates sealed working chambers between the vanes, the outer cylindrical surface of the rotor, the inner surface of the stator, and the front and rear distribution plates. With each full rotation of the rotor, the system completes two cycles of oil suction and delivery. (a) Structural diagram",text-EN.txt

259,"2) Precautions for Using Vane Pumps The main advantages of vane pumps include uniform flow, smooth operation, low noise levels, and a compact design. Vane pumps are widely used in hydraulic systems, particularly in fixed-installation hydraulic equipment and marine applications. Double-acting high-pressure variable-displacement vane pumps are also suitable for mobile machinery. Typically, the hydraulic systems in metal-cutting machine tools operate at relatively low power levels (below 20 kW) and moderate pressures (commonly around 7 MPa), while demanding stable pump output flow, minimal noise, and extended service life. By combining a low-pressure, high-flow pump with a high-pressure, low-flow pump to form a tandem vane pump, operators can achieve three distinct flow rates through simple on-off switching—making it ideal for machining equipment that requires rapid reciprocating motions combined with significantly varying working feed speeds. Moreover, the new generation of high-performance double-acting variable-displacement vane pumps is not only well-suited for stationary hydraulic systems but can also replace external gear pumps in hydraulic systems for mobile machinery. Terms of use are outlined below.",text-EN.txt
260,"(1) Preparations before installation: Thoroughly clean the pipes according to relevant regulations (welded pipes must undergo pickling followed by rinsing) to remove dirt, oxide scale, and other contaminants. Mechatronic System Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance Case Study Tutorial",text-EN.txt
261,"96 (2) Drive Method: The vane pump can be powered by either an electric motor or an internal combustion engine as the prime mover. However, the pump’s transmission system must not impose additional axial or radial forces on the vane pump’s drive shaft. The coaxial alignment between the pump’s drive shaft and the prime mover’s output shaft should be maintained within 0.1 mm, and flexible couplings are recommended whenever possible to prevent the pump shaft from being subjected to bending moments and axial loads. Additionally, the rotation direction of the drive shaft must comply with the product specifications. (3) Oil suction height. Typically, the pump's oil suction height should not exceed 0.5 meters. In piping systems with longer suction lines, the diameter of the suction pipe should be increased to prevent excessive flow resistance, which could lead to poor oil intake and negatively impact the pump's performance. (4) Selection and Filtration of Hydraulic Fluid. The working fluid should be selected strictly according to the pump’s product specifications to ensure a longer service life for the pump. A wear-resistant hydraulic oil with a viscosity range of 17–38 mm²/s is most suitable (24 mm²/s is recommended). The hydraulic fluid should be kept clean, with system filtration accuracy no lower than 0.025 mm. Additionally, a filter with a filtration rating of 0.070 to 0.15 mm should be installed separately at the oil suction port to prevent the intake of dirt and impurities. The flow capacity of the suction filter must be at least twice the pump's rated flow rate. (5) If the pump operates at a lower speed, the pump's suction inlet should be positioned upward during installation to facilitate oil intake upon startup. (6) Startup. Before starting the hydraulic pump, check whether the pipe fittings or flange connection screws at the inlet and outlet ports are securely tightened and if the seals are reliable. Also, verify that the safety valve in the system is set to the correct pressure setting. Additionally, perform a jog test to confirm that the pump’s rotation direction is correct. For the first startup, it’s best to fill the pump completely with oil and manually rotate the coupling—ensure the rotational force feels smooth and effortless. When starting the pump for the first time after initial operation or after a prolonged period of inactivity, an air suction phenomenon may occur. To prevent this, install a bleed v alve at the pump’s outlet or slightly loosen the outlet connections. Connect the port to evacuate air, and perform a trial run under no-load conditions as much as possible. (7) Mai ntenance: When adjusting the displacement and pressure of the variable vane pump, first loosen the lock nut. Pay close attention to the direction in which you turn the adjustment s crew—whether increasing or decreasing the displacement and pressure—as you make these adjustments. After completing the adjustments, securely tighten the lock nut. Additionally, en sure that the set pressure of the hydraulic system’s safety valve does not exceed 1.25 times the pump’s rated pressure. Avoid operating the pump continuously at excessively high or  low temperatures; if necessary, use a heat exchanger (including both coolers and heaters) to regulate the oil temperature. Maintain the oil tank at its normal liquid level and rep lenish the oil promptly as needed. Regularly replace the hydraulic oil according to specified intervals. Routinely inspect and clean the oil filter to ensure the pump can smoothly  draw in the oil. After the pump has been running for a while, vibrations may cause the mounting screws or the flange bolts at the inlet and outlet ports to loosen. Therefore, regul arly check these connections and retighten them promptly to prevent any loosening. 3. Common Faults and Maintenance of Vane Pumps",text-EN.txt

273,"Pressure isn't building up. Improperly adjusted variable pump p ressure has been readjusted to the required level. Here are the repair methods for the main components of a vane pump. A Case Study Tutorial on Diagnostics and Maintenance of Elect romechanical Systems 98 1) Stator Repair When a vane pump is operating, the vanes are pressed firmly against the inner surface of the stator due to the hydraulic oil pressure at the bottom and the centrifugal force acting on them, leading to wear on the stator surface. Notably, the stator surface on the suction side experiences more severe wear compared to the other side. For double-acting vane pumps, if the wear and scoring on the stator surface are relatively minor, the surface can be polished using metallographic sandpaper before reuse. However, if the wear is extensive, the stator should be reconditioned on a dedicated stator grinding machine. Alternatively, the stator can be flipped 180°, swapping the positions of the suction chamber and the oil chamber, while simultaneously creating new positioning pin holes symmetrically opposite the original ones—thus allowing the pump to continue functioning. In the case of variable pumps, where the stator surface is cylindrical, it can be clamped securely in a lathe or grinder using soft jaws for polishing and repair. Additionally, worn areas of the stator surface can also be repaired by brush plating. 2) Repair of the distribution plate and side plates The distribution plate and side plates often suffer from end-face wear and tearing. In principle, as long as the total depth of the tearing on the end face isn’t excessive (e.g., l ess than 0.8 mm), the torn grooves can be removed using a surface grinder, followed by polishing before reassembly and continued use. However, two key considerations must be kept i n mind: First, after grinding down the end face to a certain dimension, the depth of the pump body’s bore must also be reduced accordingly; otherwise, the axial assembly clearance  will increase. Therefore, it’s crucial to refer to the assembly drawing to maintain the proper relationship within the axial dimension chain. Second, after repairing the end face,  the dimensions of the unloading triangular grooves may become shorter—or even disappear entirely. If these grooves aren’t properly restored, it could negatively impact the eliminat ion of oil trapping phenomena. Thus, after grinding the distribution plate’s end face, the dimensions of the unloading triangular grooves should be carefully extended using a trian gular file or milling process. However, care must be taken not to overextend them, as this could inadvertently cause the pressure chamber and suction chamber to communicate during  operation, leading to a reduction in the pump’s output flow. Finally, ensure that the repaired distribution plate maintains proper parallelism with the rotor’s contact surface. Wit hin a tolerance of 0.01 mm, the perpendicularity between the end face and the inner bore (for the distribution plate) is also kept within 0.01 mm, while the flatness of the end fac e remains at 0.05 mm. When polishing, it’s best to avoid using metallographic sandpaper—instead, opt for chromium oxide polishing. If the distribution plate’s end face has only min or scratches, start by lightly grinding with fine oilstone, followed by finishing with chromium oxide polishing. 3) Rotor Maintenance and Repair The worn areas of the rotor are the  end faces and the blade grooves. When wear on the rotor end faces is minor, you can smooth out the roughened areas using an oilstone or repair them through grinding. If the wear i s severe, you can use a mandrel to precisely position the rotor on an external cylindrical grinder for reconditioning. After repair, it’s essential to ensure that the two end faces  remain parallel to each other. Not greater than 0.008 mm, surface roughness Ra ≤ 0.16 µm, and perpendicularity between the end face and the hole no more than 0.01 mm. Rotor end-fa ce machining After grinding, the blade width should be matched to the rotor by further grinding, ensuring that the blade width is 0.005 mm smaller than the rotor width. The blade s lots experience frequent sliding, leading to more severe wear—but the degree of wear varies significantly across individual slots. To ensure consistent clearance between each blade  and its corresponding slot, the blade slots must be precisely reworked using a specialized grinding machine, followed by individual blade matching to maintain a clearance within t he range of 0.013 to 0.018 mm. 4) Blade Maintenance",text-EN.txt
274,"The worn areas of the blade include the top section where the blade contacts the inner surface of the stator, the two side surfa ces where the blade meets the distribution plate, and the blade itself— The surface of the rotor blade groove that experiences the most severe wear is the top area where the blade contacts the inner surface of the stator. 3.2.3 Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Hydraulic Cylinders",text-EN.txt

Hydraulic Cylinder Disassembly, Assembly, and Precautions",text-EN.txt
277,"Hydraulic Cylinder Disassembly and Assembly (1) Use a wrench to loosen the lock nut on the ear pivot, then pull the piston rod out of the ear pivot. (2) Use a wrench to loosen and remove the cylinder head. (3) The piston rod, along with the piston and guide sleeve, is withdrawn together. (4) Use an external cylindrical spring caliper to remove the spring clip from the piston rod, then take off the retaining ring and keyway before carefully extracting the piston. (5) Check if the sealing ring is still usable; replace it promptly if it’s no longer functional. (6) After all removed parts have been cleaned with kerosene, replace the damaged and wear-prone components (such as sealing rings), then reassemble them in the reverse order of disassembly. 2) Precautions for Disassembling and Assembling Hydraulic Cylinders The following points should be noted when removing the hydraulic cylinder from the equipment: (1) Before disassembling the hydraulic cylinder, the hydraulic circuit must be depressurized; otherwise, when loosening the fittings connected to the cylinder, the High-pressure oil in the pipeline will quickly spray out. When relieving pressure from the hydraulic circuit, first loosen the handwheel or adjusting screw at the relief valve to allow the pressurized oil to drain, and then disconnect the power supply or energy source to stop the hydraulic system from operating. (2) During disassembly, care should be taken to prevent damage to the piston rod’s end threads, oil port threads, piston rod surface, and cylinder liner inner wall, among other components. To avoid bending or deformation of slender parts like the piston rod, ensure they are evenly supported using wooden blocks when placing them. The following points should be noted when dismantling hydraulic cylinders: (1) The disassembly of hydraulic cylinders must be carried out in a clean, dust-free environment to prevent contamination by surrounding dust, debris, and other contaminants. After disassembly, all parts should be protected against dust (e.g., covered with plastic sheeting; cotton cloths or any other industrial fabrics are strictly prohibited). (2) Drain the oil from both chambers of the cylinder before disassembly. (3) Disassembly must be carried out in a specific sequence. Since different hydraulic cylinder designs vary, the disassembly order may also differ slightly. Generally, you should first remove the cylinder cap and finish with the piston and piston rod. When removing the cylinder cap, use specialized tools for internal key-type connections (such as retaining keys or spring clips)—never use a flat chisel. For flange-type end caps, always use screws to gently push them out; hammering or prying forcefully is strictly prohibited. If the piston and piston rod cannot be easily removed, do not attempt to force them out—first identify the underlying issue before proceeding with disassembly.

278,"100 (4) After disassembly, carefully inspect to determine which parts can be reused and which require repair. 3. Common Hydraulic Cylinder Faults and Troubleshooting To address issues where the hydraulic cylinder fails to operate properly, follow the sequence below. (1) Clearly identify the nature of faults occurring when the hydraulic cylinder starts up. For example, issues such as incorrect movement speed, improper output force, lack of motion, unstable movement, incorrect motion direction, wrong action sequence, or creeping. Regardless of which specific fault arises, it can ultimately be traced back to fundamental problems—such as flow rate, pressure, directional control, positioning, or load conditions. (2) List the components that could potentially affect the occurrence of the failure. For instance, if the cylinder speed is too slow, it may be due to insufficient flow. In this case, you should first identify the components affecting the flow to the cylinder, then analyze whether the issue stems from a blocked or restricted flow valve, internal leakage in the cylinder itself, excessive leakage from the pressure control valve, or other factors. Conduct targeted inspection and testing, and proceed with repairing or replacing any unsuitable components as needed. (3) If all components are functioning properly and the hydraulic parameters in each oil section are also generally normal, further inspection should focus on factors specific to the hydraulic cylinder itself.

333,"The main parts of the hydraulic cylinder can be repaired as follows. (1) Cylinder Barrel  Repair. Common damages to cylinder barrels include internal surface scratches and wear. There are several methods available for repairing cylinder barrel damage, such as high-power  honing technology, surface bonding techniques, electro-brushing plating, arc spraying (for large-diameter hydraulic cylinders), arc welding buildup techniques (also suitable for l arge-diameter hydraulic cylinders), brazing (using soft metallic materials), and bushing methods. Note that no single repair method is universally effective—instead, the most appro priate technique should be selected based on the specific circumstances. The following sections will introduce high-power honing and surface bonding technologies in detail. ① High-Performance Honing Technology. This repair method is ideal for cylinder bores that exhibit minor deformation and shallow scoring, capable of restoring cylinders with dimensional to lerances up to 2.5 times larger than the original specifications. A high-power honing machine is used to grind areas where dimensional or shape tolerances have been exceeded, ensur ing precise restoration. The cylinder barrel meets the requirements for overall dimensions, shape tolerances, and surface roughness. ② Surface Coating Technology. When the inner su rface of the cylinder bore is heavily worn and exhibits deep scoring, surface coating technology can be employed. This method is quick, effective, and remarkably cost-efficient. To  repair the damage, first clean the inner surface of the cylinder with acetone solution, then allow it to dry completely. Next, apply a layer of repair compound (such as Loctite 60 2 or TG205 adhesive) onto the scored areas. Use a specially designed tool to smooth out the compound evenly, ensuring the adhesive fully bonds with the cylinder surface. After the  cylinder walls have been bonded together, apply a layer of repair compound (keeping the thickness about 2 mm higher than the cylinder barrel). Then, firmly scrape the compound back  and forth to smooth it out evenly, ensuring it slightly protrudes above the inner surface of the cylinder. Aim for an even, polished finish as much as possible. Once cured, lightl y sand the inner surface with fine-grit sandpaper to achieve a consistent cylinder bore diameter. (2) Piston rod maintenance. To prevent rust and enhance wear resistance, piston ro ds typically undergo hard chrome plating on their surfaces. Common forms of damage include wear, scratches, coating peeling, and bending. As piston rods are precision-machined comp onents, it’s best to avoid repairing them using buildup welding, since this process can cause deformation and may even damage other intact working surfaces. For example, consider t he  ""Case Studies in Mechanical and Electrical System Fault Diagnosis and Repair "" tutorial. 104 If the piston rod is bent, simply straighten it to meet the required specifications. If the piston rod shows signs of wear, scoring, or chrome coating peeling off, you can remove the existing coating, re-apply chrome plating, and then proceed with surface finishing. For localized damage such as scoring, electrobrush plating technology can also be used for effective repair. 3.2.4 Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Hydraulic Motors",text-EN.txt
334,"Structure and Working Principle of Hydraulic Motors As shown in Figure 3.8, the typical structure of a double-acting vane motor features the following key characteristics: The vanes are positioned radially, with symmetrical chamfers on both sides of their tips to accommodate both forward and reverse rotation requirements. At the base of each vane, a dovetail spring is installed, ensuring that the vane tip maintains constant, close contact with the inner surface of the stator—this prevents the high- and low-pressure chambers from communicating during motor startup (before centrifugal force has fully developed). Additionally, the motor housing contains a shuttle valve (consisting of two series-connected check valves), which ensures that, whenever the oil flow direction at the motor’s inlet and outlet ports changes due to switching between forward and reverse rotation, the base of each vane remains continuously supplied with high-pressure oil, thereby maintaining optimal contact between the vanes and the stator’s inner surface. 1—Casing; 2—Rotor; 3—Stator; 4—Distribution Plate; 5—Drive Shaft; 6—Front Cover; 7—Yan-style spring; 8—Leaf spring; 9—Check valve",text-EN.txt

355,"Fault Diagnosis and Repair of Check Valves Ordinary check valve (1) The structure and operating principle of a conventional check valve. The tubular straight-through check valve, as shown in Figure 3.9, allows hydraulic flu id to flow in only one direction, preventing reverse flow. The check valve consists of basic components such as a valve element (either a conical or ball valve), a valve body, and  a spring. When hydraulic oil acts against the compression spring, When fluid enters, oil pressure lifts the valve core, allowing oil to flow freely. Conversely, when hydraulic oil  flows in from the opposite end, the oil pressure and spring force push the valve core tightly against the valve seat, preventing any fluid passage. All check valves feature a taper ed valve design, which effectively ensures excellent reverse-sealing performance. The typical opening pressure for a check valve ranges from 0.035 to 0.05 MPa. Additionally, check  valves can also function as backpressure valves—simply by replacing the standard soft spring with a suitable harder one, the valve transforms into a pressure control device. When u sed as a backpressure valve, it is commonly installed in the return line of a hydraulic system to generate a backpressure of 0.2 to 0.6 MPa. 1—Valve body; 2—Spool; 3—Spring; 4, 5—R etaining rings",text-EN.txt
356,"Figure 3.9: Tubular Straight-Through Check Valve (2) Disassembly and assembly of the check valve. Disassembling and reassembling the check valve is relatively simple : just unscrew the bolts and remove the valve core along with the spring. When reinstalling, make sure the clearance between the valve core and the valve body falls within the rang e of 0.008 to 0.015 mm. If the valve core is already rusted, worn, or clogged with debris, it will need to be replaced. Clean and polish the outer cylindrical surface of the valve  core using metallographic sandpaper. Additionally, verify that the sealing elements are functioning reliably and that the spring force is appropriately adjusted. In hydraulic syste ms, check valves are widely used—commonly installed at the ports of hydraulic pumps to prevent hydraulic oil from flowing backward. They’re also employed to isolate individual oil  circuits, ensuring that one circuit doesn’t interfere with another. Additionally, they can serve as backpressure valves or bypass valves. When selecting a check valve, in addition  to choosing the appropriate opening pressure based on your needs, you should also pay special attention to ensuring that the flow rate passing through the check valve during operat ion matches the rated flow. This is crucial because if the actual flow rate through the check valve is significantly lower than the rated flow, it can lead to malfunctions in the h ydraulic system—refer to Chapter 3 for fault diagnosis and repair procedures. 107 Sometimes vibrations occur—specifically, the lower the flow rate, the higher the opening pressure  tends to be. Additionally, the more air present in the fluid, the more likely vibrations become. During installation, ensure you clearly identify the correct inlet and outlet direc tions; improper installation could disrupt the system's normal operation. This is especially critical when installing a check valve at the pump’s outlet—reversing the valve’s inlet  and outlet connections might lead to damage of the hydraulic pump or even cause the motor to overheat and fail.

Figure 3.10(a) shows the simple-type hydraulic… A one-way control valve works by directly pushing the valve spool upward as the control piston moves. This mechanism causes a sudden release of oil pressure within the high-pressure closed circuit, resulting in significant impact pressure and accompanied by loud pressure-relief noise. Figure 3.10(b) presents a case study on fault diagnosis and maintenance of unloading-type electromechanical systems. 108 The hydraulically controlled check valve works as follows: When the control piston moves upward, it first lifts the unloading spool, relieving the pressure in the main oil circuit chamber. Once this pressure is released, the main spool is pushed open, allowing fluid to flow in the reverse direction. This action reduces the control pressure while simultaneously minimizing hydraulic shock and pressure-relief noise. The applications of the hydraulically controlled check valve are as follows: Using two hydraulically controlled check valves to create a ""hydraulic lock,"" the hydraulic cylinder is locked in place, preventing it from moving and holding it securely at any desired position; as Pressure-holding valve ensures the system maintains a specific pressure over the designated time period; as a filling valve, it uses the cylinder's negative pressure to open and draw in fluid from the oil. Absorbs oil from the tank and fills the hydraulic cylinder; acting as a support valve for the vertical hydraulic cylinder, it connects the hydraulically controlled check valve to the lower chamber of the vertical cylinder. Preventing the plunger (or piston) from descending due to system leakage also enables fluid flow in both forward and reverse directions. Here are the precautions for using a hydraulically controlled check valve: Ensure that the control pressure is sufficiently high to allow the hydraulically controlled check valve to open reliably in the reverse direction. Select the appropriate structural  design of the hydraulically controlled check valve based on its role within the system, its installation location, and the magnitude of flow resistance (backpressure) in the oil o utlet chamber when fluid flows in the reverse direction. Use either two hydraulically controlled check valves or a single bidirectional hydraulically controlled check valve to crea te a circuit that locks the hydraulic cylinder in place. During operation, the system flow rate must match the rated flow capacity of the hydraulically controlled check valve. Addi tionally, clearly identify the correct flow directions for the main ports, as well as the control and drain ports, to avoid improper installation.

370,"Solenoid directional control valve The structure and operating principle of the solenoid directional control valve are illustrated in Figure 3.11. The solenoid directional control  valve uses the thrust generated by the electromagnetic coil's attraction to move the spool, thereby controlling the flow path—opening or closing it—and changing the direction of fl uid flow. As shown in Figure 3.11(a), this is the structural diagram of a 2/3-way solenoid directional control valve. When the solenoid is de-energized, the spool is pushed by a sp ring toward the left end (its normal position), connecting port P to port A. When energized, the solenoid causes the iron core to push the valve spool toward the right end via a pu shrod, connecting port P to port B while closing port A. Disconnected. As shown in Figure 3.11(b), this is the structural diagram of a three-position, four-way solenoid directional  control valve. When both solenoids are de-energized, the spool remains in the neutral position. The ports P, A, B, and T are completely isolated from each other. When the solenoid  on the left side is energized, the pushrod moves the spool toward the right end, connecting port P to port B and port A to port T. Conversely, when the solenoid on the right side  is activated, the spool shifts to the left end, establishing a connection between port P and port A. B entrance Connected to the T-port. Due to the limitations of the electromagnet ic solenoid's rated suction force, the spool diameter of the solenoid directional control valve cannot be made too large; its nominal diameter is— Generally no more than 10 mm, sui table for applications with low flow rates. For higher flow rates, hydraulic or electro-hydraulic directional control valves should be used. Electromagnetic… Valves can be classifi ed into two types based on their power supply: AC and DC. AC solenoids offer greater holding force, better starting performance, and shorter switching times. (For 0.01–0.03 s), but  the impact force during switching is significant, and if the spool gets stuck and cannot be pulled in, the electromagnetic coil is prone to burning out. DC electromagnet Reversal  is relatively slow (typically 0.05–0.08 s), resulting in low reversal impact force and extended service life. However, this design offers weak suction force during startup, requiri ng a DC power supply. Additionally, electromagnetic directional control valves can be classified into dry-type and wet-type, depending on whether the armature working chamber conta ins hydraulic fluid. The dry type does not allow pressurized oil to flow. Into the magnetic circuit, coil, and other components; in the wet type, pressurized oil is allowed to flow  into the electromagnetic core's hollow sleeve. In the dry type, measures are taken to prevent pressurized oil from entering the electromagnet. In this system, the valve's backflow  pressure must not be too high. The wet-type design offers low noise, excellent cooling and lubrication, minimal temperature rise, and a long service life, making it widely applica ble. 1—Electromagnet; 2—Pushrod; 3—Sealing Ring; 4—Spring Seat; 5—Support Spring; 6—Valve Core; 7—Valve Body;",text-EN.txt

(1) First, disconnect the machine tool's power supply and remove the electrical components (terminals) from the solenoid directional control valve. (2) Use a Phillips screwdriver to remove the solenoid directional control valve, and then detach the side baffles. (3) After removing the springs from both ends, take out the spool of the solenoid directional control valve. 2) Electro-hydraulic directional control valve The structure and appearance of the electro-hydraulic directional control valve are shown in Figure 3.12. 1. 7—Check valve; 2. 6—Throttle valve; 3. 5—Solenoid; 4—Pilot valve spool; 8—Main valve spool Figure 3.12: Structure and Appearance of the Electro-Hydraulic Directional Control Valve The electro-hydraulic directional control valve is composed of a solenoid-operated directional valve and a hydraulically actuated directional valve combined together. The solenoid valve is responsible for switching the flow direction in the control oil circuits connected to both ends of the hydraulically actuated valve, thereby changing the working position of the valve spool—this component is referred to as the pilot valve. Meanwhile, the hydraulically actuated directional valve controls the reversing of the actuator elements within the system and is thus called the main valve. This operating mechanism allows a small electromagnetic force to manage the high-flow switching of the main oil circuit, making it ideal for hydraulic systems requiring large flow rates. As shown in Figure 3.12(a), the structure of the electro-hydraulic directional valve features a three-position, four-way Y-type solenoid valve at the top as the pilot valve, while the main valve below is a three-position, four-way O-type hydraulically actuated directional valve. The centering method for the spool of the three-position, four-way electro-hydraulic directional valve can be either spring-centered or hydraulically centered. When using spring-centering, the pilot valve should be a Y-type, three-position, four-way solenoid directional valve to ensure that, when the main spool is in the neutral position, the control oil chambers on both sides remain continuously connected to the reservoir, maintaining zero pressure. This setup allows the main spool to stay perfectly centered solely under the influence of the spring force. On the other hand, if hydraulic centering is employed, the pilot valve must be a P-type, three-position, four-way solenoid directional valve to guarantee that, in the neutral position, both control oil chambers of the main spool are always pressurized. Additionally, the electro-hydraulic directional valve offers two options for controlling the oil supply to its control circuit: internal oil supply and external oil supply. In the case of internal oil supply, the control circuit draws pressure oil directly from the main oil line via port P—this is known as internal control. For external oil supply, an independent oil source is typically required, which is referred to as external control. Similarly, the return path for the control circuit can also follow either an internal return (internal leakage) or an external return (external leakage), as illustrated in Figure 3.12(b).",text-EN.txt
372,"The disassembly and assembly steps for the electro-hydraulic directional control valve are as follows. (1) Use an Allen wrench to separate the valve body on both sides, remove the springs and spring washers from each side, loosen the screws to take out the small springs and ball bearings on both sides, and finally extract the small flow control valves from each side. (2) Remove the main spool, then use an Allen wrench to loosen the solenoid directional control valve, separating it from the hydraulic directional control valve. (3) Clean all disassembled parts with kerosene, replace any damaged or worn components (such as sealing rings), and then reassemble in the reverse order. When assembling the directional control valve, in addition to checking whether the sealing elements are reliable and ensuring the spring force is appropriate, pay special attention to Chapter 3: Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Hydraulic Systems. 111 Check the clearance fit. Improper clearance fit is a major cause of mechanical failure in directional control valves. When the spool diameter is less than 20 mm, the clearance should be between 0.008 and 0.015 mm; for spools larger than 20 mm, the clearance should range from 0.015 to 0.025 mm. For solenoid-operated directional control valves, also ensure to inspect the proper functioning of the solenoid. Additionally, for hydraulically controlled valves, pay close attention to the connections and flow paths of the control oil circuit to prevent electrical or hydraulic system failures during operation.

Different spool functions can meet the varying requirement s of the system. Although some spool functions may be identical, their transition characteristics differ, which can also affect the operation of the actuating elements.

390,"Structure and Working Principle of a Direct-Acting Relief Valve A direct-acting relief valve is a type of relief valve that controls the opening and closing of the spool by directly balancing the oil pressure from the main oil circuit acting on the spool against the spring force also acting on it. Direct-acting relief valves come in three basic spool designs: slide valve, conical valve, and ball valve. Figure 3.13(a) shows the structural diagram of a direct-acting relief valve with a slide valve spool configuration. The valve primarily consists of a screw plug 1, a spool 2, and a valve body. Upper cover, 4. Locking nut, 5. Pressure-adjusting spring, 6. Adjustment nut, 7. Adjustment rod, and more components make up the assembly. The overflow valve can be configured with either internal or external oil drainage. As shown in Figure 3.13(a), when port L is blocked, the oil at the upper end of the spool flows through port E directly to port T—this is known as internal drainage. In internal drainage, the back pressure at the return port T acts directly on the upper surface of the spool, while the spring balances the pressure difference between the inlet and outlet. On the other hand, if port E is blocked and port L is opened instead, allowing the oil to flow directly back to the reservoir via a dedicated oil line, this configuration is referred to as external drainage. 1—Screw plug; 2—Valve core; 3—Valve body; 4—Upper cover; 5—Lock nut;",text-EN.txt

For example, in a hydraulic power unit equipped with a fixed-displacement pump, this is used to adjust the pump's outlet pressure and maintain it at a constant level. (2) Pressure limiting. When used as a safety valve, the relief valve remains closed during normal system operation and only opens to relieve excess pressure when the system pressure exceeds its set pressure, thereby providing overload protection for the system. Characteristics of the relief valve: The valve is connected in parallel with the load, the overflow port is routed back to the oil tank, and it uses imported pressure negative feedback. 3. Disassembly and Assembly of the Relief Valve",text-EN.txt
392,"1) Valve body disassembly (1) Clamp the valve body in a vise with the threaded plug facing upward (note: ensure the vise jaws do not damage the mating surfaces). (2) Use a wrench to remove and install the threaded plug (be careful not to let the spring pop out), then take out the main valve core and the spring. 2) Assembly of the relief valve (1) Carefully clean all removed parts with kerosene, replace any damaged or worn components (such as sealing rings), and then reassemble in the reverse order of disassembly.

394,"Assembly sequence. (2) The main spool should move freely within the valve body without any sticking or obstruction, and its clearance typically ranges between 0.015 and 0.025 mm. (3) The main spool, pilot spool, and their respective valve bodies should have a reliable seal. (4) A pressure adjustment test should be conducted after assembly. When assembling the relief valve, pay special attention to ensuring that the spool moves smoothly. After disassembly, use metallographic sandpaper to carefully polish the outer cylindrical surface of the spool, removing rust, burrs, and other imperfections. Also, thoroughly clean the damping holes in the slide valve to prevent clogging. Make sure the slide valve can move freely, and verify that the spring is neither too soft nor too stiff—cracks or bends are strictly prohibited. Finally, install a screw plug at the pilot-controlled port, tightening it securely to prevent leaks, and ensure that sealing gaskets and paper washers at all joints are properly positioned. Lastly, double-check that all connecting screws are tightly fastened. 4. Precautions for Using Relief Valves (1) The type of relief valve should be selected based on the system's operating conditions and requirements. Generally, direct-acting relief valves respond more quickly and are ide ally suited for use as safety valves, while pilot-operated relief valves offer superior opening and closing characteristics, making them ideal for applications requiring pressure r egulation or constant-pressure control. Whenever possible, choose relief valves with excellent opening and closing performance to enhance both the speed-load characteristics of the  actuating elements and the overall efficiency of the circuit. (2) The specifications of the relief valve should be selected appropriately based on the system's pressure and flow r ate. For relief valves used as remote pressure regulators, their through-flow typically ranges from 0.5% to 1% of the flow rate passing through the main relief valve (the primary v alve) connected to the remote control port. (3) The set pressure of the relief valve should be determined and adjusted based on its intended use and function within the system. Whe n used as a safety valve, its set pressure must not exceed the system's maximum operating pressure. (4) When adjusting the voltage, ensure you rotate the adjustment mechanism in th e correct direction. After completing the adjustment, securely tighten the lock nut. (5) If it is necessary to remotely adjust system pressure, relieve the load, or implement multi -stage pressure control via the remote port of the pilot-operated relief valve. If necessary, unscrew the screw plug on the remote control port and connect it to the control oil ci rcuit; otherwise, seal the remote control port tightly. (6) If it is necessary to change the pressure adjustment range of the relief valve, this can be achieved by modifying the st iffness of the adjusting spring. However, it should also be noted that altering the spring stiffness may affect the valve's opening and closing characteristics. (7) When the relief  valve is used as an unloading valve, its return port should be connected directly to the oil tank to minimize back pressure. (8) The voltage, current, and wiring configuration of  the solenoid relief valve must be correct. (9) The valve installation and connection must be correct, the interface seals must be tight, and the external oil drain port must be dir ectly connected to the oil tank. 5.

403,"Structure and Working Principle of a Direct-Acting Pressure Reducing Valve As shown in Figure 3.14, the inlet pressure ( P_1 ) is reduced to ( P_2 ). When the spool is in its original position, the inlet and outlet remain fully open, keeping the valve in its normally open state. The control pressure for this valve is derived directly from the outlet. When the outlet pressure ( P_2 ) rises to the setpoint value, the spool reaches its critical point of upward movement. If ( P_2 ) continues to increase beyond this point, the spool moves further upward, partially closing the valve port. This action increases the fluid resistance, leading to a greater pressure drop across the valve and, consequently, a reduction in the outlet pressure. Conversely, if the outlet pressure ( P_2 ) decreases, the spool moves downward, reopening the valve port and reducing the fluid resistance. As a result, the pressure drop across the valve diminishes, allowing the outlet pressure to recover. In this process, if friction forces, the weight of the spool, and steady-state hydrodynamic forces are neglected, the spool is balanced solely by the downward hydrodynamic force (equal to the outlet pressure) acting on its lower surface and the upward spring force (approximately equal to the setpoint pressure). This balance ensures that the outlet pressure remains stable under normal operating conditions. Originally, the set pressure remained unchanged. The pressure relief valve is primarily used to reduce and stabilize the oil pressure in a specific branch of the system, commonly employed in troubleshooting and maintenance case studies for electromechanical systems such as clamping, control, and lubrication applications. 116 In the oil circuit.

405,"3. Selection and Usage Precautions for Pressure Relief Valves (1) The type of pressure-reducing valve should be selected based on the system's operating conditions and requirements, and note The trend in the opening and closing characteristics of a pressure-reducing valve is opposite to that of a relief valve (as the flow rate through the pressure-reducing valve changes). (When increased, the outlet pressure decreases slightly.) Additionally, note that the relief valve has a higher oil leakage compared to other valves—oil continuously flows out from the pilot valve (sometimes as much as 1 L/min or more), which can affect the selection of the hydraulic pump capacity. (2) The specifications of the pressure-reducing valve should be selected appropriately based on the system's pressure and flow rate. (3) The outlet pressure should be determined and adjusted based on the deceleration valve's intended use and function within the system. It is crucial to consider the relationship between the deceleration valve's set pressure and the load pressure of the actuating element. (4) When adjusting the voltage regulator, ensure you rotate it in the correct direction. After adjustment is complete, securely tighten the lock nut. (5) If multi-stage pressure reduction control of the system is required via the remote port of the pilot-operated relief valve, the screw plug on the remote port should be removed and connected to the control oil circuit; otherwise, the remote port will remain tightly sealed. (6) The valve installation and connections must be correct, with tight sealing at all interfaces. Additionally, the relief port of the pressure-reducing valve must be routed directly back to the oil tank. 4.

413,"Structure and Working Principle of a Direct-Acting Sequence Valve As shown in Figure 3.15, this is a schematic diagram illustrating the working principle of a direct-acting sequenc e valve. The primary oil pressure P1 is introduced into the lower chamber of the small piston 6 through channels in the valve body 4 and the lower end cap 7. During operation, the  pressurized fluid delivered by the pump first overcomes the load on cylinder I, initiating its movement. As the load on cylinder I increases, so does P1. When P1 rises to a point w here the hydraulic force acting on the bottom of the small spool exceeds the spring force, the valve spool moves upward, fully opening the valve port. This connects P1 (which corre sponds to cylinder I) with P2 (which corresponds to cylinder II), thereby driving cylinder II to move. The control cylinders I and II operate sequentially. The illustrated state re presents the internally controlled configuration; however, if you rotate the lower end cap by 90°, remove the screw plug K, and connect it to an external oil source, the system swi tches to externally controlled mode. In this case, the drain port L must be routed directly back to the oil tank separately.

By adjusting the control method, the relief mechanism, and the connection configuration of the second ary oil circuit, sequence valves can also function as backpressure valves, unloading valves, and balance valves, among other applications. Precautions for Using Sequence Valves (1) The control method of the sequence valve—whether internal or external—should be selected based on the system's operating characteristics and requirements. (2) The selected sequence valve should not have an opening pressure that is too low, as this could lead to unintended actuator movements due to leakage. (3) The oil-bleed method for sequence valves is typically external, so the bleed port must be connected directly back to the reservoir. Additionally, ensure that the bleed circuit does not experience excessive backpressure, as this could interfere with the proper operation of the sequence valve. (4) A sequence valve with excessively poor opening and closing characteristics can lead to excessively high primary pressure when the flow rate is too high, thereby reducing system efficiency.

437,"1. Structure and Working Principle of a Check Flow Control Valve As shown in Figure 3.18, this is a structural and appearance diagram of a unidirectional throttle valve. In the figure, the valve spool is divided into an upper spool and a lower spool. Oil flows in from P1, passes through the valve port, and exits at P2—this represents forward flow, with the throttling principle identical to that of a conventional throttle valve. Meanwhile, oil flows from P2 When entering and flowing out from P1 in the reverse direction, the pressurized oil pushes the lower spool downward, causing it to act as a one-way valve and allowing fluid to flow freely in the reverse direction. Application scenarios: Since the throttle valve lacks pressure and temperature compensation devices, it cannot counteract speed fluctuations in the actuator caused by changes in load or oil viscosity. Therefore, it is typically suitable only for hydraulic systems with relatively stable loads and where high speed stability is not critical. Additionally, the throttle valve can also be used for cushioning actuator movements or limiting flow rates in multi-cylinder circuits designed to prevent interference among cylinders.

449,"Structure and Working Principle of the Speed Control Valve As shown in Figure 3.19, this is a diagram illustrating the structure and appearance of the flow control valve. The inlet pressure P1 is reduced to Pm by the pressure-reducing valve, after which Pm splits into three paths: the first path flows through hole f into chamber d, the second path flows through hole e into chamber c, and the third path passes through the orifice of the throttle valve to generate… The pressure drop is reduced to P2. Pressure oil (P2) flows into the hydraulic cylinder from the outlet on one side, while on the other side it enters cavity b via port a. Adjust… The speed control valve maintains a constant pressure difference across its throttling port thanks to the automatic compensation provided by the reducing valve. If the inlet pressure P1 of the speed control valve has already been set and held constant by the relief valve, then when changes in the load cause the outlet pressure P2 to rise, the reducing valve responds by adjusting itself— As the pressure in chamber B increases, the spool moves downward, increasing the opening h of the relief valve port, which reduces the pressure drop and, in turn, causes Pm to rise—thereby ensuring… P = Pm - P2 remains constant; when the load change causes P2 to decrease, the fluid pressure in cavity b drops, prompting the spool of the relief valve to move upward and increasing the valve opening height h. Reducing the pressure drop increases Pm while still ensuring that P remains constant. As shown in Figure 3.19, this illustrates the structure where pressure reduction occurs before throttling. Speed control valves can also be designed with throttling preceding pressure reduction—both configurations operate on essentially the same principle. Some speed control valves are internally equipped with a check valve: when fluid flows in the forward direction, the valve functions as a speed regulator; however, in the reverse flow direction, it does not provide speed control, allowing fluid to pass freely. These are referred to as unidirectional speed control valves. The application of a flow control valve is similar to that of a throttle valve, primarily used in throttle-speed control circuits, but it can also be employed in volumetric-throttle-speed control circuits. Selection and Usage Notes for Speed Control Valves (1) When installing the flow control valve, the inlet and outlet must not be connected in reverse; otherwise, the pressure compensation device will fail to function. (2) When selecting a flow control valve, ensure that its minimum stable flow rate is lower than the minimum flow required by the actuator. (3) When the system requires exceptionally high speed stability of its actuators, or when used for micro-feed applications, a temperature-compensated variable-speed valve should be selected. (4) To ensure the proper operation of the flow control valve, the working pressure differential across the valve should exceed the valve’s minimum pressure differential, Pmin. Typically, the Pmin for high-pressure valves is 1 MPa, while the minimum pressure differential for low-pressure valves is 0.5 MPa.

464,"As shown in Figure 3.20, the working principle of the tailstock sleeve in the CNC lathe hydraulic system is as follows. (1) When solenoid 5YA is de-energized and solenoid 6YA is energized, the sleeve extends. At this time, the oil inlet path is as follows: Tank 1 → Filter 2 → Hydraulic Pump 3 → Check Valve 4 → Pressure Reducing Valve 13 → Directional Control Valve 14 (left position) → Rodless Chamber of the Hydraulic Cylinder. The oil return path is: Rod Side of the Hydraulic Cylinder → Flow Control Check Valve 15 → Directional Control Valve 14 (left position) → Tank 1. The working preload during sleeve extension is adjusted via Pressure Reducing Valve 13 and displayed by Pressure Gauge 16, while the extension speed is controlled by Flow Control Valve 15.

466,"(3) Check the fuel tank level to ensure it’s above the minimum mark, verify that the filter and suction pipe are not exposed above the oil surface, and confirm the return line is positioned higher than the oil level to prevent air from entering the tank. (4) Manually operate the directional control valve 14. If the spool cannot be pushed, it indicates that the directional control valve is malfunctioning. If the valve successfully switches positions and the hydraulic cylinder moves, it means there’s a fault in the solenoid valve’s electrical wiring. If the hydraulic cylinder still fails to move, proceed to the next step of inspection. (5) Manually adjust the one-way flow control valve 15 by increasing its opening. If the hydraulic cylinder moves, it indicates that the one-way flow control valve is blocked; otherwise, loosen the valve knob completely and proceed with further inspection. (6) Adjust the pressure relief valve 13. If the hydraulic cylinder moves, it indicates that the relief valve is either blocked or improperly adjusted; otherwise, turn the relief valve knob to its loosest setting and continue troubleshooting. (7) Check the pump station pressure. Ensure that directional control valve 14 is in the neutral position, then verify whether the pressure gauge 17 at the pump outlet reads the set value. If not, perform the following checks: Confirm that the pressure gauge switch is turned on and that the gauge itself is not damaged; inspect whether the hydraulic pump’s pressure adjustment spring is too loose; check if the suction oil filter is partially clogged or insufficient in capacity, and if the suction line is partially blocked; finally, examine whether the pump is damaged or experiencing severe internal leakage. Afterward, actuate the directional control valve to reverse its position. If the hydraulic cylinder moves as expected and its speed meets operational requirements, the issue has been resolved. However, if the cylinder’s speed still fails to meet specifications, the hydraulic pump will need repair. If, even after adjusting the pump pressure higher, the cylinder still doesn’t move, proceed to the next step of troubleshooting. (8) Switch the directional control valve 14 to the right position and observe the reading on pressure gauge 16. If the reading differs significantly from that on pressure gauge 17, it indicates that the right-side pipeline or the one-way flow control valve 15 is blocked; if the readings are similar, it means there is no blockage.

Attach a pressure gauge and a shut-off valve to the other two ends of the three-way fitting, respectively. Then, shift the directional control valve 14 to the left position and note the reading on pressure gauge 16.

472,"(5) Summarize the lessons learned. 2. Methods for Diagnosing Pneumatic System Faults 1) Empirical method The method of diagnosing the location and identifying the cause of a fault—primarily relying on practical experience and using simple instruments—is known as the empirical approach . This approach can be likened to Traditional Chinese Medicine's four-step diagnostic process for patients:  ""observation, auscultation and olfaction, inquiry, and palpation. "" (1) Observation. For example, check whether the movement speed of the actuator shows any abnormal changes; verify if the pressure readings on the gauges at each measurement point  meet the specified requirements and remain stable without significant fluctuations; ensure that the lubricating oil quality and drip rate are within acceptable limits; confirm whe ther condensate is draining properly; inspect if the air exhausted from the directional control valve’s vent port is clean; monitor whether the indicator lights on the solenoid val ves are functioning correctly; examine whether any fastening screws or pipe fittings have become loose; check for kinks or crushing in the pipelines; and look for any noticeable vi brations—or assess whether there have been any changes in the quality of the processed products. (2) Listening. This includes both auditory and olfactory observations. For example,  check whether there are any unusual sounds when the cylinder or directional control valve changes direction; listen for air leaks from various points while the system is stopped b ut not yet depressurized, noting the volume of the leak sound and how it varies daily; also, determine if the solenoid coils or sealing rings emit a distinct odor due to overheatin g. (3) Inquiry: This involves reviewing the technical documentation of the pneumatic system to gain insights into its operating procedures, performance requirements, and key techni cal parameters; examining product catalogs to understand the function, structure, capabilities, and performance characteristics of each component; consulting maintenance and inspec tion records to assess the status of routine upkeep activities; and speaking directly with on-site operators to gather firsthand information about equipment operation, identify ear ly warning signs preceding potential failures, and learn about the conditions under which malfunctions occur. Additionally, it includes understanding previously encountered faults  and the methods used to resolve them. (4) Check: Feel and assess the temperature of externally moving components, as well as any temperature rise around the electromagnetic coil. I f the surface feels hot after touching it for 2 seconds, investigate the cause immediately. Also, check for vibrations in cylinders, pipes, etc., whether the cylinder exhibits any  creeping motion, and look for air leaks at all connections and component interfaces. The empirical method is simple and easy to apply, but due to differences in individual percepti on, practical experience, and judgment abilities, diagnosing faults can have certain limitations. 2) Reasoning and Analysis Method Inference analysis is a method that systematicall y dissects system failures by logically reasoning from surface symptoms, progressively narrowing down from the overall picture to specific components, ultimately pinpointing the ro ot cause of the issue. The principles of the reasoning analysis method are as follows. (1) Analyze step by step—starting from the easy to the difficult, from simple to complex, and moving from surface-level issues to underlying problems—to eliminate the fault.",text-EN.txt

For instance, in a pneumatic system controlled by solenoid valves, Chapter 4 focuses on fault diagnosis and maintenance of pneumatic transmission systems.",text-EN.txt
475,"129 The root cause of the failure in the sequential control system, where the cylinder fails to actuate, is essentially insufficient pressure inside the cylinder, lack of pressure altogether, or inadequate thrust generated to move the load. Several potential reasons could lead to this issue, as outlined below. (1) The solenoid valve is malfunctioning. (2) There’s an issue with the control circuit—specifically, the control signal isn’t being transmitted. This could be due to a faulty limit switch that fails to send a signal, a counter receiving no signal, a relay malfunctioning, or perhaps the sensors used on the cylinder aren’t properly installed in their intended positions. (3) Cylinder malfunctions, such as dust entering the gap between the piston rod and the end cap guide sleeve, which can damage the cylinder barrel; piston seizure due to sticking in the cylinder bore; sealing failure; or the cylinder’s upper throttle valve remaining closed. (4) Pipeline failures, such as insufficient pressure regulation by the pressure-reducing valve, air leaks in the gas lines, and excessive pressure loss in the pipelines. (5) Insufficient air supply from the gas source.",text-EN.txt
476,"4.2 Maintenance of Pneumatic Systems Maintenance of pneumatic systems can be divided into daily maintenance and periodic maintenance. The former refers to the maintenance tasks that must be performed every day, while the latter includes maintenance activities conducted weekly, monthly, or quarterly. All maintenance work should be documented for easy reference during future troubleshooting and repairs. Routine Maintenance The primary tasks of routine maintenance include maintaining the condensate drainage system, lubrication system, and air compressor system. Maintenance of the Condensate Drain System Condensation in compressed air can cause rusting of pipes and components. To prevent condensation from entering the compressed air system, it’s essential to promptly drain any accumulated moisture from all parts of the system. The condensate drainage system encompasses the entire pneumatic system—from air compressors and aftercoolers, through air receivers and piping networks, all the way to individual air filters, dryers, and automatic drains. At the end of each workday, condensate should be drained from all points to prevent freezing when nighttime temperatures drop below 0°C. Additionally, as pipe temperatures continue to fall overnight, more condensate may form; therefore, it’s also essential to drain accumulated water before starting up equipment each morning. Regularly inspect automatic drains and dryers to ensure they’re functioning properly, and make sure to clean air filters and automatic drains on a routine basis. 2) Maintenance of the Lubrication System",text-EN.txt
477,"In pneumatic systems, all surfaces with relative motion—from control components to actuator elements—require lubrication. Insufficient lubrication can increase frictional resistance, leading to poor operation of pneumatic components and causing leaks due to wear on sealing surfaces. When the pneumatic device is running, check whether the oil mist lubricator's oil drip rate meets the requirements and whether the oil color appears normal. If you notice that the oil level in the reservoir hasn’t decreased, adjust the drip rate promptly; if adjustment doesn’t resolve the issue, the lubricator may need servicing or replacement. 3) Maintenance of the Air Compressor System Daily maintenance for the air compressor includes checking for unusual noises and abnormal heating, ensuring the lubricant level is normal, and verifying that there is sufficient cooling water supplied to the water-cooled aftercooler in the compressor system. 2. Regular Maintenance The main components of regular maintenance are leak checks and lubricator maintenance. (1) Inspect all system leak points. Compressed air loss due to leaks can lead to significant financial losses. This section is a tutorial on diagnosing and repairing mechanical system failures.",text-EN.txt
478,"130 Inspections should be conducted at least once a month, and any areas found to have leaks must be repaired immediately. Leak checks should be performed during the workshop’s daytime  downtime—such as during breaks—or after working hours. At these times, pneumatic equipment is no longer in operation, resulting in reduced noise levels inside the workshop. Howeve r, some air pressure still remains in the pipelines, allowing you to pinpoint leak locations simply by listening for the characteristic hissing sound. Additionally, when checking f or leaks, applying soapy water or similar solutions at each inspection point can enhance detection sensitivity, making it easier to spot even minor leaks compared to relying solely  on auditory cues. (2) By inspecting the exhaust port of the directional control valve, determine whether the lubricating oil is at the proper level and check for any presence of c ondensation in the air. If lubrication is inadequate, verify that the oil mist generator is dispensing oil properly and confirm that its installation location is correct. If signif icant amounts of condensation are being discharged, inspect whether the condensate drainage system is appropriately designed and ensure that the filter is installed in the correct  position.",text-EN.txt
479,"(3) Check whether the safety valve and emergency safety switch operate reliably. During regular maintenance, it is essential to verify their operational reliability to en sure both equipment and personal safety. (4) Observe whether the directional control valve operates reliably. Check if the spool or seals are worn (for example, if there’s still le akage even when the valve’s exhaust port is closed, it often indicates an early stage of wear), and replace the component if necessary. Alternatively, you can repeatedly cycle the  solenoid valve and assess its performance by listening to the switching sound—this will help determine if it’s functioning properly. (5) Repeatedly switch the directional control v alve to observe the cylinder's movement and determine whether the piston seals are functioning properly. Inspect the exposed portion of the piston rod for scratches, corrosion, or  uneven wear. Assess the contact between the piston rod and the guide bushing/seal ring inside the end cap, as well as the quality of compressed air treatment. Also, check if the cy linder is subjected to any lateral loads. Finally, verify whether there are any leaks at the cylinder head joint.",text-EN.txt
480,"(6) Regularly inspect the secure installation of travel valves, li mit switches, and travel stops to prevent operational malfunctions. (7) When refilling the oil mist lubricator, pay attention to the decreasing level in the oil reservoir cup. If y ou notice that the oil consumption is too low, you must readjust the oil drip rate. If, after adjustment, the drip rate remains insufficient or no oil is dripping at all, check whe ther the selected lubricator model is appropriate, verify if the inlet and outlet ports are installed backward, and inspect whether the oil passages are blocked.

When the piston moves to the left… When moving, the intake valve closes as the gas inside the cylinder is compressed, squeezing the air within—this process is known as the compression phase. Once the pressure inside the cylinder rises slightly above the pressure in the delivery pipe, the exhaust valve opens, allowing the compressed air to flow into the delivery line; this stage is called the exhaust process. The reciprocating motion of the piston is driven by an electric motor (or internal combustion engine), which rotates a crankshaft.

Compressed air enters through the inlet and is directed into the cyclone blades, which feature numerous small notches angled at a specific angle. These notches cause the air to rotate violently in a tangential, reverse direction, effectively trapping Larger water droplets, oil droplets, and dust particles mixed within the gas experience greater centrifugal force, causing them to collide with the inner wall of the water collection cup and separate from the gas. These contaminants then settle at the bottom of the cup. Next, the gas passes through a central filter element, which further removes even finer impurities, resulting in clean air that is eventually discharged through the outlet port. A deflector plate is installed to prevent gas turbulence from swirling up the accumulated wastewater in the water collection cup, thereby avoiding disruption of the filtration process. To ensure the air filter operates efficiently, it’s essential to promptly drain the collected wastewater from the cup using the manual drain valve.

From there, it passes through a shut-off valve and flows into the upper chamber 'c' of the oil cup, pressurizing the oil surface. Meanwhile, the hole 'b' on the vertical rod, positioned opposite to the airflow direction, experiences reduced pressure due to the high-speed air flow surrounding it. Below the airflow pressure, this creates a pressure difference between the oil surface pressure and the pressure at hole B, causing the lubricating oil to flow through the suction mechanism under the influence of this pressure differential.

509,"Structure and Operating Principle of the Pressure Regulator As shown in Figure 4.5, this is a diagram illustrating the structure and operating principle of the QTY-type direct-acting pressure reducing valve. When the valve is in operation, compressed air enters from the left end, passes through the throttling port 10 for pressure reduction, and then exits from the valve outlet. By adjusting the handle 1 and compressing springs 2 and 3, the diaphragm 5 is pushed downward, causing the valve stem 8 to move the spool assembly downward as well. This action opens the throttling port 10, allowing compressed air to flow through while undergoing throttling, thereby reducing the output air pressure below the input pressure—thus achieving the pressure-reducing function. Meanwhile, a portion of the outgoing airflow enters the diaphragm chamber 6 via the damping hole 7, generating an upward force beneath the diaphragm 5. This upward force continuously acts to reduce the opening of the throttling port, helping to lower the output pressure. Once the force acting on the diaphragm balances with the spring force, the output pressure of the pressure reducing valve stabilizes at a certain level. Within a certain range, the smaller the opening of valve port 10, the stronger the throttling effect—and the greater the pressure drop. 1—Handle; 2 and 3—Pressure-adjusting springs; 4—Relief port; 5—Diaphragm; 6—Diaphragm chamber; 7—Damping orifice; 8—Valve stem; 9—Reset spring; 10—Valve port; 11—Vent hole Figure 4.5: Structural and Operational Diagram of the QTY-Type Direct-Acting Pressure Reducing Valve When the input pressure fluctuates—for instance, if the input pressure rises momentarily—the output pressure downstream of valve port 10 also increases accordingly, causing the pressure inside diaphragm chamber 6 to rise as well. This disrupts the original force balance, prompting diaphragm 5 to move upward. As a result, a small amount of gas is released through relief port 4 and vent hole 11. Simultaneously, thanks to the action of reset spring 9, the output pressure begins to decrease until… Until a new balance is established, the output pressure after rebalancing essentially returns to its original value. Conversely, if the output pressure drops momentarily, diaphragm 5 moves downward, increasing the opening of the air inlet and reducing the throttling effect, which in turn causes the output pressure to rise back to nearly its original level. By adjusting handle 1, regulating springs 2 and 3 return to their free state, causing the output pressure to drop to zero. Under the action of reset spring 9, the valve core closes the air inlet port, thereby putting the pressure-reducing valve into a shut-off state with no airflow output. 2.

When 1YA de-energizes, the cart stops and waits for the extruded material to arrive. Once the material is in place, the hydraulic shear mounted on the cart begins cutting the material. At this point, the designer’s original intention was to energize 3YA and 4YA, causing valves 2 and 3 to shift their positions. After entering the free intake-exhaust state, this allows the material-squeezing process to continue uninterrupted while the carriage is shearing the material. This approach significantly enhances both the yield of the squeezed product and the overall final product quality—truly a key feature of the pneumatic system design for this extruder's receiving carriage: follow-along shearing. However, during debugging, it was discovered that the carriage did not operate as expected throughout the follow-along shearing process.

548,"1) Fault Symptoms (1) Valve 3 does not change direction after being energized during follow-up shearing. (2) Valve 2, although energized to reverse direction during follow-up shearing, operates unreliably. Since the system appeared simple, it wasn’t given much attention during initial debugging—instead, it was handled as usual, with the assumption that the issue stemmed from contamination of the new components or system elements. Despite multiple disassemblies for inspection and cleaning, the fault remained unresolved. A straightforward test conducted on Valve 2 and Valve 3 revealed that these valves themselves were functioning properly. However, even after reinstalling them, the problem persisted. After a thorough analysis of each step in the cart’s operational sequence, along with a detailed examination of how Valves 2 and 3 operate, we concluded that this malfunction was caused by an inherently flawed design and component selection. 2) Analysis of the operating principles of Valve 2 and Valve 3",text-EN.txt
549,"The valves 2 and 3 used in this system are 80200-series, two-position, three-way solenoid directional control valves (base model from Germany's Haileon company). These are two-stage valves, consisting of a miniature, direct-acting, two-position, three-way solenoid valve paired with a pneumatically controlled main valve. The operational pressure requirements for this valve are… Ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 MPa, the minimum working pressure is 0.2 MPa; below this value, the main spool cannot ensure reliable directional control and reset.",text-EN.txt
550,"3) Pressure Analysis in the Two Chambers of the Car Cylinder Valve 1's 1YA is energized, causing the rodless chamber of the carriage cylinder to receive air while the rod-side chamber exhausts. Once the carriage reaches the material-handling position, 1YA de-energizes, and valve 1 returns to its original position. At this point, since the rodless chamber was still pressurized before valve 1 reset—due to its prior state of being vented—the chamber retains a residual pressure (the exact magnitude of which depends on the system). (Unspecified), the rod-side chamber is nearly at zero pressure because the valve was venting before resetting. From the analysis of how valves 2 and 3 operate, as well as the pressure dynamics within the carriage cylinder chambers, it becomes clear that during follower shearing, although valve 3 is energized, it cannot shift its main spool due to the lack of sufficient residual pressure in its rod-side chamber—pressure necessary to actuate valve 2. Meanwhile, valve 2 might still be able to shift, thanks to some residual pressure present in its capless chamber; however, since this pressure level is unpredictable, even if valve 3 is energized, its shifting action remains unreliable. 3. Problem Solving",text-EN.txt
551,"From the analysis above, it is inappropriate to select this type of two-stage, pneumatically controlled main valve for the vehicle's pneumatic system. Yes, there are two solutions:",text-EN.txt
552,"Switch to direct-acting components Simply replace the original valves 2 and 3 with 23ZVD-L15 (normally closed type). However, since the original valves 2 and 3 operate on DC 24 V, while the new valve requires AC 220 V, an intermediate relay will need to be added. Improve the car's pneumatic system Replace valves 2 and 3 with a K35K2-15 air-controlled slide valve, using one of the existing valves (either valve 2 or valve 3) as its pilot control valve—note that the original normally closed type must be modified into a normally open configuration. The specific system diagram is shown in Figure 4.12. Although this approach requires modifications to the piping system, it effectively achieves the desired functionality. It’s slightly more complex, but when analyzed in terms of the effectiveness and reliability of follower-driven shearing, it outperforms Method 1. Additionally, two unidirectional flow control valves have been added to fine-tune the carriage speed. Currently, most of the solenoid directional control valves offered by pneumatic component manufacturers—both domestically and internationally—are two-stage designs, featuring a pilot stage followed by a main stage. To ensure proper operation, there is typically a working pressure range. When selecting equipment or addressing issues on-site, it’s essential to conduct a comprehensive analysis that takes into account the specific characteristics of the production process and the performance of the components.

557,"147 Electrical equipment can experience a wide variety of failures during operation, leading to equipment shutdowns that disrupt production—and in severe cases, even result in personal injuries or equipment accidents. The causes of these failures include, in addition to the natural aging of electrical components, a significant number of issues arising from neglecting routine maintenance and upkeep of the equipment. This often allows minor problems to escalate into major incidents. Additionally, some failures occur due to improper handling techniques employed by electrical technicians when addressing faults, reliance on makeshift solutions due to missing parts, or misjudgments and inaccurate measurements that inadvertently widen the scope of the problem. Therefore, to ensure the reliable operation of electrical equipment, minimize downtime caused by repairs, and ultimately enhance equipment utilization and overall productivity, it is crucial to prioritize regular maintenance and proper care of electrical systems. Furthermore, it’s essential to maintain an adequate stock of key electrical components and frequently replaced parts tailored to the specific needs of each facility’s equipment and production processes. 5.1 Causes and Types of Electrical Faults Electrical equipment failures are inevitable. Even with effective measures such as daily maintenance, routine inspections, and periodic calibration and repairs, it remains impossible to guarantee the long-term, flawless operation of electrical devices without ever encountering an electrical fault. Causes of Electrical Faults Electrical faults primarily arise from the following two factors. (1) Natural Failures. During operation, electrical equipment is often subjected to numerous adverse factors. For example, mechanical vibrations during equipment operation; the thermal effects of overcurrents accelerating insulation degradation and deterioration of electrical components; arcing that causes damage; natural wear and tear from prolonged use; environmental influences such as temperature and humidity; corrosion from harmful substances; inherent quality issues within the components themselves; and even the equipment's natural lifespan—all these can lead to various types of failures that disrupt normal functioning. Therefore, strengthening routine maintenance, upkeep, and periodic inspections can help ensure that electrical equipment remains trouble-free—or experiences far fewer failures—for an extended period. However, it’s crucial not to mistakenly assume that equipment failures are inevitable and thus overlook the importance of consistent daily maintenance and regular overhaul work. (2) Human-induced failures. During operation, electrical equipment can experience accidents—or even pose risks to personal safety—due to unintended mechanical forces causing damage, improper handling, or inadequate installation practices. Types of Electrical Faults Due to the diverse structures of electrical equipment and the wide variety of electrical components, the factors that lead to electrical failures are equally numerous. Consequently, the faults that occur in electrical devices are bound to be just as varied and complex. Classified by Failure Phenomenon Fault phenomena can be broadly categorized into the following two main types. (1) Faults with obvious external characteristics that are easy to detect. For example, significant heating, smoking, emitting a burnt odor, or sparking in motors or electrical equipment. These types of failures typically result from motor or equipment winding overloads, insulation breakdown, short circuits, or ground faults. When addressing these issues, in addition to replacing or repairing the faulty components, it’s essential to identify and eliminate the root causes that led to the problems in the first place. (2) Failures with No Visible Symptoms. This type of failure is a major issue in control circuits, often caused by improper adjustment of electrical components, mechanical malfunctions, poor or loose contact at contacts and crimped wire terminals, as well as the damage of small parts or even broken wires. The more complex the circuit, the higher the likelihood of encountering these kinds of faults. Although minor, they occur frequently—and because they lack obvious external signs, pinpointing the exact fault location can often take considerable time. In some cases, it may even require consulting specialized tutorials on diagnosing and repairing electromechanical system failures. 148",text-EN.txt
558,"Various measuring instruments and tools are essential for pinpointing the fault location. Once the fault is identified, it often requires only a simple adjustment or repair to immediately restore the equipment to normal operation. Therefore, the ability to quickly locate the fault is critical in minimizing downtime when addressing this type of issue. Classified by Fault Location Classified by the location of the fault, the main types include power supply failures, wiring faults, and component failures. (1) Power failure. The power supply primarily refers to the energy source that provides power to electrical equipment and control circuits—it is essential for electrical devices. The foundation for the operation of control circuits. Variations in power supply parameters can lead to failures in electrical control systems, and power supply issues typically ac count for about 20% of all faults in control circuits. When a power supply failure occurs, the control system may exhibit the following symptoms: even after an electrical switch is  turned off, voltage remains present at the terminals of connected devices, or the equipment casing becomes energized; certain system functions become intermittent or erratic, lead ing to repeated blown fuses; the faulty control system fails to respond, with no indicators lighting up at all; or some circuits operate normally while others fail to function prop erly. Given the wide variety of power sources, each with its own unique characteristics, and considering that different electrical devices may display varying fault behaviors under  the same power parameters, diagnosing and locating power supply issues can be particularly challenging. (2) Circuit Faults. Both wire faults and faulty connections in the wiring s ystem fall under the category of circuit faults. Wire faults typically occur when the insulation layer deteriorates or becomes damaged, leading to wire breakage. On the other hand,  faulty connections are usually caused by loose, oxidized, or moldy connections. When a circuit fault occurs, the control circuit may exhibit issues such as poor contact, intermitt ent power supply, or severe overheating. (3) Component Failure. In an electrical control circuit, dozens—or even more—different types of components are used, and each component can  fail in its own unique way.",text-EN.txt
559,"5.2 Maintenance and保养 of Electrical Equipment (1) The doors, covers, locks, and oil-resistant seals around the door frames of electrical cabinets must  all be in good condition. Doors and covers should close tightly, ensuring no water droplets, oil stains, or metal shavings enter the cabinet—this prevents damage to electrical equi pment and avoids potential accidents. (2) The flexible conduits connecting electrical equipment components—whether they are wires, cables, or protective conductors—must not be corr oded by coolant, oil stains, or similar substances. Additionally, there should be no loosening or fraying of the conduit ends at connections. During inspections, if any such issues  are detected, they should be promptly repaired to prevent insulation damage that could lead to short-circuit failures. (3) The button stations of electrical equipment, buttons on  control panels, handles of master control switches, signal lights, and instrument covers must all be kept clean and in good condition. (4) Maintenance and保养 cycle for electrical eq uipment. Electrical components housed within electrical cabinets are typically not frequently monitored by opening the doors; instead, they rely primarily on regular maintenance an d保养. The frequency of this maintenance should be determined based on factors such as the equipment’s design, usage patterns, and environmental conditions. As a general guideline, e lectrical equipment maintenance can often be carried out concurrently with the first- and second-level maintenance tasks performed on the associated mechanical equipment. For examp le, the first-level maintenance of metal cutting machine tools is typically performed once every quarter, with operation times ranging from 6 to 12 hours depending on the complexit y of the machine. During this maintenance, the following tasks can be carried out on the electrical components inside the machine tool's control cabinet: ① Clean out any accumulated dust or foreign objects from the cabinet;",text-EN.txt
560,"② Repair or replace electrical components that are about to fail; ③ Organize and tidy up the internal wiring to ensure it looks neat and professional—especially for temporary measures taken during emergency repairs, these should ideally be resto red to their original, proper configuration; ④ Tighten the movable parts of fuses to ensure good contact; ⑤ Secure all wiring terminal screws and pressure screws on electrical components, ensuring that every wire connection is firm and reliable to minimize contact resistance; ⑥ Perform a powered-up test run to verify that the operational sequence of the electrical components is accurate and dependable. Chapter 5: Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Electrical Systems",text-EN.txt
561,149,text-EN.txt
562,"When maintaining and servicing electrical components, pay special attention to checking contactors and relay c ontacts that experience frequent operation and carry high currents. To withstand the mechanical stress and electrical arcing caused by frequent circuit switching, most contactors a nd relays have contacts made from silver or silver alloys. A natural layer of silver oxide or silver sulfide forms on their surfaces, but this does not affect conductivity—indeed,  under the influence of electric arcs, it can even revert back to pure silver. Therefore, avoid wiping or removing this protective layer unnecessarily. Even if the surface of these silver-based contacts develops scorch marks or becomes uneven, it typically won’t compromise their ability to maintain good electrical contact, so there’s no need to file or smooth them down. However, copper contacts should be promptly resurfaced if they show signs of burning or roughness. When inspecting contactors and relays that produce noticeable noise, first identify the root cause and address it before continuing operation. If the issue persists despite repairs, the component should be replaced with a new one. Verify the thermal relay to ensure it operates correctly. The verification results should match the thermal relay's operational characteristics. Verify the time relay and check whether its delay time meets the specified requirements. If the error exceeds the allowable tolerance, adjust or repair it promptly to ensure it once again complies with the required standards. 5.3 Maintenance and Fault Diagnosis of Electrical Equipment",text-EN.txt
563,"Methods for Overhauling Electrical Equipment When it comes to electrical faults in equipment, repairs aren’t particularly challenging—but pinpointing the exact cause of the problem can be extremely difficult. That’s why quickly identifying the root cause and location of the fault is crucial, making it essential to gather accurate, firsthand information right from the start. On-site investigations and visual inspections are the primary methods and approaches for obtaining this vital initial data, and the process can be vividly summarized in four key steps: ""Observe, Ask, Listen, and Test."" Hope",text-EN.txt
564,"After a failure occurs, it often leaves behind certain signs of the malfunction; when inspecting, you can start with the following aspects. (1) Inspect for visual changes, such as activation of the fuse indicator device, peeling of insulation from the winding surface, oil leakage from the transformer tank, loose or detached wiring terminals, and malfunctions in various signaling devices. (2) Observe color changes. Some electrical equipment exhibits color shifts when temperatures rise—for example, after a short-circuit fault occurs in a transformer winding, the transformer oil heats up and changes from its original bright yellow to black or darker shades. Similarly, the color of generator stator slot wedges may turn black and darken due to overheating. 2) Question",text-EN.txt
565,"Ask the operator about the circumstances before and after the failure occurred. Typically, the questions include: Did the fault happen before startup, right after startup, or during operation? Did the equipment stop automatically during operation, or was it stopped by the operator after detecting an abnormal condition? At the time of the failure, what specific operating procedure was the equipment performing, and which button was pressed or which switch was toggled? Were there any unusual signs—such as noises, odors, smoke, or sparks—immediately before or after the malfunction? Has a similar issue occurred previously, and if so, how was it resolved? Often, these inquiries can yield valuable insights, helping to analyze the root cause of the failure based on how the electrical equipment is designed and operates.",text-EN.txt
566,"3) Listen Elect rical equipment produces different sounds during normal operation versus when a fault occurs, allowing you to identify the nature of the problem by listening. For instance, when a  motor is running properly, the sound should be smooth and steady, without any extraneous noises or unusual tones. However, if you hear a loud  ""buzzing "" sound, it indicates that the load current is too high. If the  ""buzzing "" is particularly intense, it suggests the motor is operating under a single-phase condition. A  ""gurgling "" noise might signal that the bearing clearance is abnormal or that the ball bearings are damaged. And if there’s a severe grinding or scraping sound, it points to a potential mech anical failure in the rotating machinery system. 150",text-EN.txt
567,"Sub-surface pitting and broken, dislodged rotor bars; if a  ""hissing "" sound is present, it indicates the bearings are lacking lubrication. 4) Cut The so-called  ""cut "" refers to inspecting the electrical system using the following method. (1) Use your hands to feel the temperature of the faulty motor, transformer, and coils of certain electrica l components in the area being inspected. Typically, temperatures will rise noticeably when a fault occurs, allowing you to determine whether a problem exists simply by touch. (2)  Perform a power-off check on the circuit. Before inspection, disconnect the main power supply, then systematically identify the fault location based on areas where failures may occ ur. ① Remove dust and dirt to eliminate the risk of electrical leakage. ② Check the connection status of each component's wires and the condition of the terminals for rust. ③ Inspe ct the condition of elastic components and electrical contact parts for wear, natural wear, and fatigue wear. ④ Check moving parts for rust, dirt, dried-up grease, and mechanical d amage. For previously inspected electrical systems, it’s also necessary to verify that the replaced components match the original circuit requirements in terms of model and specifi cations, confirm the correct wire gauge for connections, ensure proper wiring methods without errors, and check whether any other wires or components have shifted, been reconnected  incorrectly, or sustained damage. After completing these checks, any identified faults should be promptly addressed—this will eliminate potential issues such as leakage currents,  poor contact, and short circuits, thereby restoring the system to its original functionality. (3) Perform a power-on check of the circuit. If the power-off check fails to identify  the fault, proceed with a power-on inspection of the equipment. ① Check the power supply. Use a multimeter to verify that the power voltage is within the normal range, and ensure t here are no phase failures or significant imbalances. ② Check the circuits. The inspection sequence is as follows: first inspect the control circuit, then the main circuit; next, e xamine the auxiliary system, followed by the main drive system; start with the AC system, then move on to the DC system; finally, check the switching circuit before inspecting the  adjustment system. Control. Alternatively, follow the circuit's operational sequence: first, turn off all switches and remove all fuses. Then, starting from the back and moving for ward, sequentially insert the fuses for each section being checked, close the switches, and observe whether each electrical component operates as expected. Continue this process st ep by step until the faulty component or area is identified. ③ During power-on checks, the fault range can also be determined by examining the control knobs and adjustable componen ts of the circuit. Since the circuit is divided into distinct sections—each interconnected yet functionally independent—faults can be roughly pinpointed based on whether the adjust able parts are functioning properly, whether their adjustment ranges have shifted, whether the control components are operating normally, and whether the interlocking relationships  between these components remain intact. Once the general fault area is identified, further narrowing down the issue is achieved by systematically testing critical points, ultimate ly leading to the discovery of the faulty component. 2. Using Instruments for Electrical Circuit Fault Diagnosis The method of identifying faults using instruments and meters is ca lled the detection method, with the multimeter being one of the most commonly used tools. By measuring parameters such as voltage, resistance, and current with a multimeter, you ca n determine whether a circuit is conducting or broken—and pinpoint the exact location of the fault—based on how these measured values change. Resistance Measurement Method The principle diagram of a certain electrical resistance step-measurement method is shown in Figure 5.1. The circuit fault manifests as the contactor KM1 coil failing to energize when the start button SB2 is pressed. (1) Hierarchical Measurement Method. First, disconnect the power supply, then turn the multimeter's selector switch to the resistance "" "" range. Press and hold SB2 while measuring the resistance between points 1 and 6. If the resistance reads infinity, it indicates an open circuit. Next, measure the resistance between each pair of points: 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, and 1-5. If you notice a sudden increase in resistance between any specific pair of points, it means that either the contact at that point or the connecting wire has become faulty. Chapter 5: Fault Diagnosis and Repair of Electrical Systems",text-EN.txt
568,"151 Poor contact or open circuit. Different electrical components and wires have varying resistance values, so the resistance thresholds used to determine whether a circuit or component is faulty also differ accordingly. For instance, when measuring across the terminals of a fuse holder, a resistance value below 0.5 ohms indicates normal operation, while a reading above 10 kΩ suggests an open circuit with no continuity. A resistance in the range of several ohms or higher typically points to poor contact. However, these criteria may not apply universally to other components or wires. Table 5.1 provides reference ranges for the resistance values of commonly used components and wires. Figure 5.1: Resistance Step Measurement Method",text-EN.txt

If a very high resistance is detected between two points, it indicates poor contact at the contacts in that section or an open circuit in the wire. For instance, if a significantly high resistance is measured between points 2 and 3, it means that… The stop button SB1 has poor contact or the connecting wire is open-circuited.

572,"Figure 5.3: Voltage Tiered Measurement Method When measuring, set the multimeter to the AC voltage range of 500 V. In a normal circuit, you should read the standard voltage (set as 220 V). First, use a multimeter to measure the voltage between points 1 and 6, then press and hold the start button while simultaneously connecting the black test probe to At point 6, the red test lead is moved forward sequentially according to the markings 5, 4, 3, and 2, measuring the electrical resistance between 6-5, 6-4, 6-3, and 6-2, respectively. Voltage: Under normal conditions, the voltage at each stage of the circuit is 220 V. If no voltage is detected between terminals 6 and 5, it indicates an open circuit. Fault—at this point, you can move the red test lead forward. When it reaches a specific point (such as point 2) and the voltage returns to normal, it indicates that the contacts before point 2 are functioning correctly. Alternatively, the wiring may be intact, while the contacts or connections after point 2 are open-circuited. Typically, the first contact immediately following this point (point 2) — just across The connection wire for the stop button SB1 contact is open-circuited.

When measuring downward, if the measured values for each step are… If the voltage equals the supply voltage, it indicates that the contact or connecting wire just measured has an open-circuit fault. (2) Segmented Measurement Method. The voltage segmentation measurement method for the failure in the above example is shown in Figure 5.4. First, use a multimeter to test points 1 and 6. If the voltage reads 220 V, it indicates that the power supply voltage is normal. Next, proceed to Chapter 5: Fault Diagnosis and Repair of Electrical Systems. 153 Use the red and black test leads to measure the voltage segment by segment between adjacent pairs of terminals: 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, and 5-6. If the circuit is functioning properly, the voltage between any two adjacent points should read zero—except for the 5-6 pair, where the voltage will equal 220 V. However, if you measure 220 V between a specific pair of adjacent terminals, it indicates that either the contacts or the connecting wires in that section are experiencing poor contact or have an open circuit. If the voltage between two points is 220 V, it indicates that the normally closed contact of contactor KM2 is making poor contact or the connecting wire is open-circuited. 3) Short-Circuit Method The short-circuit method involves using a well-insulated wire to temporarily connect the suspected component. This method is employed to troubleshoot the fault in the example above. The fault is shown in Figure 5.5. If the circuit suddenly turns on, it indicates a break somewhere in the circuit. Before proceeding with further checks, use a multimeter to measure the voltage between terminals 1 and 6. If the voltage is normal, press and hold the start button SB2 without releasing it. Then, using an insulated wire, briefly connect it across each of the following pairs: 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, and 4-5. If, when the wire is connected across a particular pair, contactor KM1 engages, it indicates that the open-circuit fault lies between those two points.

(2) The short-circuit method is only suitable for detecting open-circuit faults in wires and contacts with extremely low voltage drops. As for components with higher voltage drops, For open-circuit faults such as those in resistors, coils, or windings, the shorting method should not be used, as this could lead to a short-circuit fault instead.

The recommended method is to gently wipe the affected area with anhydrous alcohol or another highly volatile, non-corrosive organic solvent while the power is off—simply until the stain is completely removed. When cleaning, keep three key points in mind: First, ensure the solvent has minimal water content; otherwise, excessive moisture could lead to equipment rusting, slow drying times, and degraded performance of insulating materials due to water absorption. Second, take strict fire safety precautions—no open flames or sparks are permitted at the work site. Finally, choose a solvent that won’t damage the original insulation layers, warning labels, or the glossy finish on plastic casings. (2) Insulation failure caused by aging.",text-EN.txt
579,"This failure was caused by the insulation layer operating continuously under high temperatures and corrosive conditions. After insulation aging occurs, it is often accompanied by a practical guide to diagnosing and repairing electrical and mechanical system failures. 154 Phenomena such as brittleness, cracking, flaking, and whitening may occur. If you encounter any of these issues, immediately replace the wire or component to prevent more extensive damage. At the same time, it’s crucial to identify the root cause of insulation aging and eliminate any factors that might be accelerating it. For instance, if overheating of the wire is responsible for insulation degradation, not only should the underlying issue be promptly addressed, but also ensure that the insulating tape wrapped around the wire connections meets the required standards. Typically, 3 to 5 layers of insulating tape are ideal—avoiding excessive thickness, as this can trap heat at the connection points, leading to oxidation and poor electrical contact. When wrapping, make sure the tape isn’t too loose or uneven; instead, apply it tightly to provide effective protection against water and moisture. Additionally, any exposed wire cores must be properly repaired and crimped securely—no loose ends, burrs, or sharp edges should remain, as these could puncture the insulating tape, potentially causing electrical leakage. (3) Insulation damage caused by external forces. At this point, the entire wire should be replaced. If external forces cannot be easily avoided, appropriate protective measures should be taken for the wire—such as covering it with an insulating sleeve, using braided wire, or coiling the wire into a spiral shape. If immediate replacement of the wire is not possible, as an emergency measure… Alternatively, you can also use insulating tape to bandage the injured area, but this should only be done if the working environment permits. 2. Wire Connection Fault When encountering poor wire contact, first remove the oxide layer and any dirt from the wire ends, then clean the oxide buildup on the fixed connection points before re-establishing the connection. Be sure to keep the following points in mind during the process. (1) To prevent direct contact between two different metals, such as copper and aluminum, a copper-aluminum transition plate can be used. (2) For situations where the wire is too thin or the fixed section has excessive space, resulting in insufficient clamping pressure, you can fold the wire back and forth several times to create multiple strands, or bend the wire’s tip into a loop before tightening it securely. If necessary, you may also add an additional washer. (3) When the wire is difficult to connect to the fixed part, you can tin the wire and also tin the fixed part—this usually ensures good electrical contact. (4) For long-term, high-current operation under special conditions, to enhance the conductivity of the connection points, wires can be directly soldered together using tin solder. Additionally, employing larger mounting hardware (to facilitate heat dissipation), applying a thin layer of petroleum jelly (to prevent exposure to air), and increasing the clamping force on the wires can all help improve the electrical performance of the connections. (5) When connecting wires, all joints must be made directly on the terminal blocks; splicing wires by stripping and joining them in the middle of the conductor is strictly prohibited. Typically, no more than two wires should be connected to each terminal block. When bending wires into an arc shape, they should be wrapped clockwise around the terminal post to prevent the wires from loosening as the nut is tightened. (6) Low-voltage connections require higher reliability than high-voltage connections. Since low-voltage systems have lower voltages, it’s less likely for even tiny air gaps or microscopic impurities between wires to cause breakdown. Therefore, silver-plated connectors and wire soldering are typically used. (7) For faults in fine wire connections—such as the coil in a multimeter's test lead—the coil should generally be replaced. A high-voltage arc method is recommended to melt and weld broken ends together; however, manual connections often result in limited lifespan due to insufficient mechanical strength and inadequate insulation performance. 5.5 Common Faults and Maintenance of Low-Voltage Electrical Appliances The electrical control systems of机电 equipment typically use low-voltage electrical devices as their system components and electric motors as the power source. Consequently, electrical faults in机电 equipment primarily occur in these two types of devices. Additionally, in highly automated机电 equipment such as CNC machine tools, failures in programmable controllers also serve as a major cause of equipment downtime. This section will introduce repair and diagnostic methods for these types of failures. Low-voltage electrical equipment refers to devices used in low-voltage (1200 V and below) power networks, capable of responding to operational signals and external field conditions. Chapter 5: Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Electrical Systems",text-EN.txt
580,"155 The device in question is an electrical component designed to automatically or manually alter the state or parameters of a circuit, enabling functions such as controlling, protecting, measuring, indicating, regulating, and converting circuits or controlled objects. It serves as the most fundamental element in constructing low-voltage control circuits. Commonly used low-voltage electrical appliances include protective low-voltage control devices, such as fuses and residual current devices; control devices like contactors, relays, solenoid valves, and electromagnetic brakes; and master command devices, including universal transfer switches, push buttons, and limit switches. 5.5.1 Contactor A contactor is an electrical device used to automatically switch large-current circuits on or off. It can frequently connect or disconnect AC and DC circuits and enables remote control. Depending on the type of circuit being controlled, contactors are broadly classified into two main categories: AC contactors and DC contactors. AC Contactor An AC contactor is an electrical device that uses electromagnetic attraction combined with spring force to operate the closing and opening of its contacts. In control circuits for机电 equipment, it’s commonly used to connect or disconnect the power supply to motors and control circuits. The contactor primarily consists of an electromagnetic system and a contact system. The contact system includes main contacts and auxiliary contacts, while the electromagnetic system comprises components such as an electromagnetic coil, moving iron core, stationary iron core, and a return spring. The basic operation of electromagnetic attraction works as follows: When the electromagnetic coil is de-energized, the spring’s reaction force—or the moving iron core’s own weight—keeps the main contacts open. However, once the electromagnetic coil is connected to its rated voltage, the electromagnetic force overcomes the spring’s resistance, pulling the moving iron core toward the stationary iron core. This movement closes the main contacts, simultaneously actuating the auxiliary contacts as well. Following the principle of tackling easier tasks first, inspect the coil before checking the power supply and mechanical components to avoid unnecessary disassembly. Also, assess the contactor.",text-EN.txt
581,"Whether it's normal should be determined according to the following work steps. (1) Electrical inspection: The two terminals of the contactor coil should remain conductive. When measured with a resistance range, they should show a resistance between roughly 10 and several tens of ohms. If the resistance exceeds 2 ohms, check the coil circuit for poor connections or open wires. Phenomenon: When the resistance value is too low—such as in a small contactor measuring just a few ohms or even fractions of an ohm—it’s advisable to check for short-circuiting. (2) Mechanical component inspection: When manually or with other tools pushing the armature, the movement should be smooth and free, with no sticking or jamming. After the contacts engage, applying additional force should still allow for a defined travel distance. Once the hand is released, the contacts must quickly return to their original position, and the contact action must occur in perfect synchronization. (3) Power-on inspection: When the coil is supplied with the rated voltage, the contactor should operate reliably; there should be no noticeable noise after it pulls in, and it should reset quickly when power is cut off.",text-EN.txt
582,"Common faults and repair methods for AC contactors are described below. (1) Coil Failure. Coil failures can be categorized into overheating burnout and coil breakage. There are several reasons for coil burnout: for instance, if the supply voltage is too high—exceeding 110% of the rated voltage—or too low—dropping below 85% of the rated value—it can lead to contactor coil damage. This occurs because the contactor armature fails to engage properly, resulting in a reduced impedance in the coil circuit and causing excessive current flow. Additionally, discrepancies between the actual power supply frequency and the rated value, mechanical obstructions preventing the armature from closing, or uneven mating surfaces on the iron core that widen the air gap during engagement can all contribute to this issue. Environmental factors, such as poor ventilation, excessive humidity, or abnormally high ambient temperatures, may also trigger coil burnout. Coil breakage typically results from overheating and subsequent burnout, though it can occasionally be caused by external physical damage. Different countermeasures should be taken depending on the specific fault cause. If the issue is due to a faulty coil, simply replace it with an identical model. If the iron core is contaminated or its pole surfaces are uneven, clean the pole surfaces as needed or replace the iron core altogether.",text-EN.txt
583,"(2) Contactor contact welding. ① Frequent device startups, where the main contacts are repeatedly subjected to inrush currents, or prolonged passage of currents exceeding the rated value through the contacts, can both lead to contact overheating or welding. In the former case, proper operating procedures should be followed to avoid frequent starts, or alternatively, a suitable electromechanical system fault diagnosis and repair case study guide should be consulted. 156 Contactor with adjustable operating frequency and duty cycle. For the latter, reduce the load on the driven equipment to ensure it operates at its rated capacity, or reselect a sui table contactor based on the equipment's actual working current. If the controlled device is a three-phase motor, verify that the three-phase contacts are synchronized. If they’re  out of sync, the motor will briefly run on a single phase during startup, causing excessive inrush current—so adjustments should be made accordingly. ② There is a short-circuit poi nt on the load side. When the contactor pulls in, the short-circuit current flows through the main contacts, causing them to weld together. In this case, you should inspect the loc ation of the short-circuit point and eliminate the fault. ③ Contact pressure is abnormal. Unreliable contactor engagement or vibrations can result in insufficient contact pressure,  causing the contacts to fail to properly connect. Increased contact resistance leads to severe heating of the contacts. To check the contact pressure during adjustments, you can u se the paper-strip method: Place a strip of paper slightly wider than the contacts between them. When the AC contactor is closed, if the paper can be easily pulled out, it indicate s that the contact pressure is insufficient; however, if the paper tears, it means the pressure is too high. ④ Severe oxidation and burn damage on the contact surfaces increase con tact resistance, leading to welding of the contacts. If the oxide layer consists of silver oxide, it doesn’t necessarily need to be removed; however, if it’s copper oxide, gently s crape it off using a small knife. For any dirt or grime, clean the surface thoroughly by wiping with a cloth dampened with gasoline or carbon tetrachloride. If the contacts are sco rched or have burrs, carefully reshape the surface using a small knife or a specialized file—but avoid making the surface overly smooth, as excessive smoothness can actually reduce  the contact area between the mating surfaces. Additionally, never use sandpaper to refine the contact surfaces, as this could cause abrasive particles (like diamond grit) to becom e embedded, compromising the contacts’ ability to make proper electrical contact. If the contacts have already fused together, it’s crucial to identify the underlying cause and rep lace the contacts entirely during repairs. (3) The contactor fails to pull in after being energized, or it pulls in but then immediately releases. When an AC contactor fails to eng age after power is applied, first check whether the electromagnetic coil is receiving its rated voltage across its terminals. If no voltage is detected, the fault likely lies withi n the control circuit—inspect and address the issue accordingly based on the specific circuit configuration. If voltage is present but falls below the coil’s rated value, the elect romagnetic force generated by the energized coil won’t be strong enough to overcome the spring’s opposing force; in this case, either replace the electromagnetic coil or modify the  circuit connections. However, if the coil is receiving its rated voltage, further investigation may be needed to identify any underlying problems. The issue could be an open circu it in the electromagnetic coil itself, which can be checked using the resistance setting on a multimeter. If the wiring screws are loose, they should be tightened; if the electroma gnetic coil is broken, it needs to be replaced. Additionally, mechanical mechanisms in the contactor's moving parts, as well as issues like stuck or jammed moving contacts, rusted  pivots, or skewed shafts, could all potentially occur. This results in the contactor coil failing to pull in after being energized, or pulling in improperly. For the former issue,  the mechanical linkage mechanism can be repaired, the arc-extinguishing shield adjusted, and the position of the contacts relative to the shield fine-tuned to eliminate any frictio n between them. In the latter case, a thorough inspection and disassembly are required—clean the pivot shaft and supporting rods, and replace any worn or damaged components as nece ssary. The contactor briefly pulls in and then immediately releases, usually due to poor contact in the auxiliary contacts of the contactor's self-locking circuit, which causes the  circuit's self-locking function to fail. (4) Abnormal contactor engagement. Abnormal contactor engagement refers to issues such as excessively slow contactor operation, incomplete  closure of the contacts, loose core attraction, and unusual noises emanating from the core—none of which are normal. When a contactor fails to engage properly, you can check for t he underlying causes in the following areas and take appropriate corrective actions based on your findings. ① If the control circuit's supply voltage drops below 85% of its rated v alue, the electromagnetic force generated when the solenoid coil is energized will be insufficient to quickly pull the moving iron core toward the stationary iron core, resulting i n slow or incomplete contactor engagement. In this case, you should check the power supply voltage of the control circuit and adjust it to the rated operating voltage as needed. ②  Improper spring pressure can lead to abnormal contactor operation. If the spring's reaction force is too strong, it may cause the contactor to engage excessively slowly. Additional ly, if the spring pressure on the contacts—or the release pressure—is set too high—this can prevent the contacts from closing fully. In such cases, simply adjusting the spring pres sure accordingly, or replacing the spring if necessary, will resolve these issues. ③ The core pole surfaces have expanded outward and become uneven over time due to frequent, prolo nged collisions along the lamination thickness direction, or the short-circuit rings may have broken, causing the core to emit unusual noises. Chapter 5: Fault Diagnosis and Repair  of Electrical Systems 157 (5) After the contactor coil is de-energized, the iron core fails to release. This malfunction poses significant risks, potentially leading to uncontroll ed equipment operation and even causing equipment damage—thus requiring strict preventive measures. The possible causes are outlined below. ① The contactor core pole face was defor med due to impact, causing the gap on the contact surface of the central magnetic pole in the  ""mountain "" -shaped core to gradually disappear. Failure causes significant residual magnetism in the iron core after the coil is de-energized, leading to the moving iron core sticking firml y to the stationary iron core and preventing the AC contactor from releasing even when power is cut off. To address this issue, you can file and carefully reshape the contact surfa ces of the iron cores, ensuring that the gap between the central magnetic pole and the surrounding areas remains no larger than 0.15 to 0.2 mm. Next, precisely grind the  ""mountain ""-shaped contact surface on a surface grinder until it’s smooth, while also adjusting the central magnetic pole to sit 0.15 to 0.2 mm lower than the two side magnetic poles. This a pproach effectively prevents the occurrence of this type of malfunction. ② Excessive oil stains and dust buildup on the core pole faces, or insufficient spring pressure in the movi ng contact, can also prevent the AC contactor coil from releasing after power is cut off. For the former issue, simply removing the oil stains will suffice; for the latter, adjust  the spring pressure—and if necessary, replace the spring with a new one. ③ Contactor contact welding can also cause the iron core to fail to release after the AC contactor coil is  de-energized; refer to the methods mentioned earlier for troubleshooting. ④ This type of failure can also occur if installation does not meet requirements, or if the anti-rust oil on the new contactor core surface has not been removed. If the issue stems from improper installation, simply reinstall it correctly; but if anti-rust oil remains stuck to the core surface, simply wipe it clean. 2. DC Contactor DC contactors can be classified according to their application into general industrial DC contactors, traction DC contactors, and high-inductance DC contactors. General industrial DC contactors are commonly used in machine tools and other electromechanical equipment to control various types of DC motors. The common faults of DC contactors are essentially the same as those of AC contactors, so fault analysis can be conducted by referring to the AC contactor failure scenarios described above. 5.5.2 Relay The primary function of a relay is to control, protect, regulate, and transmit signals within electrical circuits or devices. However, its contact capacity is relatively small—typically 5 A or less—meaning relays are not suitable for interrupting heavy loads. This is precisely why relays differ from contactors. The main differences among these devices. Depending on the type of input signal, relays can be classified into temperature relays that operate based on temperature signals, current relays triggered by current signals, pressure relays activated by pressure signals, and speed relays that respond to velocity signals. Various types, including time relays. Below are introduced common methods for diagnosing and repairing these relays.",text-EN.txt
584,"1. Thermal Relay Electric motors frequently encounter overload conditions during actual operation. If the overload current is not excessive and the duration of the overload is relatively short—such  that the temperature rise in the motor windings remains within permissible limits—then this type of overload is considered acceptable. However, if the overload current is too high  or lasts for an extended period, it can cause the winding temperature to exceed safe levels, leading to insulation damage, reduced motor lifespan, and, in severe cases, even burni ng out the motor windings altogether. To fully utilize the motor's overload capacity while ensuring smooth starting and reliable operation—and to prevent winding overheating and su bsequent burnout—thermal relays are typically employed as overload protection devices for electric motors. The commonly used thermal relay is of the bimetallic strip type, consisti ng primarily of a bimetallic strip, resistance wire (the heating element), and contacts. During operation, the heating element is connected in series with the motor's main circuit,  while the normally closed contacts are串联ed with the contactor coil in the control circuit. When the motor becomes overloaded, the normally closed contacts of the thermal relay ope n, cutting off the motor's control circuit and simultaneously disconnecting the main power supply. To restart the motor, a specific amount of time must elapse—allowing the bimetall ic strip to cool down—before pressing the manual reset button to restore the contacts to their original position. Common faults in thermal relays and their corresponding repair met hods are described below. (1) The thermal relay is not properly connected to the main circuit or control circuit. ① A blown heating element or a desoldered connection at the heatin g element's input/output terminals can cause the thermal relay to fail to conduct when connected to the main circuit. This issue is addressed in the tutorial on diagnosing and repa iring mechanical-electrical system faults. 158 You can use a multimeter to perform continuity tests, or you can open the cover of the thermal relay for a visual inspection—but neve r remove the heating element at will. If the heating element is burned out, it must be replaced with one of the same specifications; and if any wire ends have become detached from  soldering, they should be resoldered securely. ② The setting current adjustment cam (or adjusting screw) has been turned to an improper position, causing the normally closed contac t to open; alternatively, the normally closed contact may have burned out, resulting in an open control circuit when the thermal relay is connected. For the first issue, you can op en the cover of the thermal relay, inspect the cam mechanism responsible for its operation, and adjust it to the correct position. In the second case, you’ll need to replace the co ntact along with the associated spring. ③ The wiring screws in the main or control circuit of the thermal relay were not tightened properly; over time, they loosened, resulting in  an open circuit in either the main or control circuit. Simply check and tighten the wiring screws to resolve the issue. (2) Thermal relay malfunction. Thermal relay malfunction ref ers to the phenomenon where the relay trips even though the motor is not overloaded. ① Since the motor protected by the thermal relay is frequently started, the heating element is  repeatedly subjected to the impact of inrush current. Alternatively, if the motor takes too long to start, the heating element may carry the starting current for an extended period . Both scenarios can lead to false tripping of the thermal relay. For the first case, motor startups should be limited or a semiconductor thermistor temperature relay could be used  instead. In the second scenario, measures can be implemented in the control circuit—such as short-circuiting the thermal relay during startup—to allow the motor to run normally af ter the initial start-up phase. ② An error (tending to be lower) in the thermal relay’s current adjustment scale can lead to false tripping. In this case, follow the steps below fo r proper adjustment: First, turn the current-adjustment cam toward the higher-current setting, then restart the equipment. After the equipment has been running normally for about 1  hour, slowly adjust the current-adjustment cam back toward the lower-current setting until the thermal relay trips. Finally, gently rotate the adjustment cam further toward the hi gher-current side to fine-tune the setting. ③ When the motor load increases dramatically, it can cause excessive current to flow through the heating element. Alternatively, if the  adjusting components of the thermal relay become loose, the set current of the heating element may drop too low, leading to false tripping of the thermal relay. For the first issue , the root cause—such as an overloading motor—should be identified and resolved. For the second scenario, simply remove the cover of the thermal relay, inspect the operating mechan ism and its components, tighten any loose parts, and then readjust the settings accordingly. (3) The motor has burned out, but the thermal relay has not yet tripped. The possible r easons include the following scenarios. ① The thermal relay's adjustment scale may be inaccurate (overestimated), or its adjusting components could have become loose, leading to an excessively high set current. When the  motor operates under overload conditions, although the load current is sufficient to raise the temperature of the heating element and cause the bimetallic strip to bend, it still w on’t generate enough force to move the actuator plate or the temperature-compensating bimetallic strip. As a result, the motor overheats due to prolonged overloading and eventually  burns out. The troubleshooting method is similar to adjusting the thermal relay's scale. Error (underestimation) fault handling is the same. ② The operating mechanism becomes jamm ed, causing the guide plate to disengage; alternatively, if the thermal element is subjected to a short-circuit current, the bimetallic strip may suffer permanent deformation. As a  result, when the motor is overloaded, the relay fails to trip, potentially leading to motor burnout. To address this issue, first open the thermal relay cover, inspect the operati ng mechanism, reinsert the guide plate, and then press the reset button several times to ensure the mechanism moves smoothly. If the bimetallic strip has undergone permanent deform ation, it must be replaced. ③ After maintenance, the thermal relay was inadvertently installed with the bimetallic strip facing the wrong way; alternatively, the wrong heating elem ent for the bimetallic strip was used, causing current to flow through the heating element without enabling the bimetallic strip to push the actuating lever. As a result, the motor  overheated and eventually burned out, yet the thermal relay failed to trip. ④ Damage to the self-cooling fan, blocked air ducts leading to poor heat dissipation, and higher ambien t temperatures can all cause the motor to burn out before the thermal relay even activates. When installing a thermal relay, ensure that the cross-sectional size of the connecting  wires is appropriate. If the wires are too thin, axial heat conduction will be poor, potentially causing the thermal relay to trip prematurely. Conversely, if the connecting wires  are too thick, axial heat conduction will occur rapidly, possibly leading to a delayed response from the thermal relay. Chapter 5: Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Electrical Sys tems 159 Action: For thermal relays with a rated current of 10 A, it is recommended to use a single-strand plastic-insulated copper wire with a cross-sectional area of 2.5 mm²; the  rated current For a 20 A thermal relay, it is advisable to use a single-strand plastic-insulated copper wire with a cross-sectional area of 4 mm²; for a thermal relay rated at 60  A, it is recommended to choose Use a 16 mm² multi-strand plastic-insulated copper wire.",text-EN.txt
585,"2. Speed Relay A speed relay, also known as a reverse-connection braking relay, works in conjunction with a contactor to enable braking of an electric motor. The speed relay consists of three main components: the stator, the rotor, and the contacts. The rotor of the speed relay is a permanent magnet, directly connected to the shaft of the motor being controlled. The stator is fixed to a mounting bracket, constructed from stacked silicon steel laminations and equipped with a squirrel-cage winding. When the motor shaft rotates, the rotor spins along with it, generating a rotating magnetic field within the air gap surrounding the rotor. This induced rotating field, in turn, generates currents within the squirrel-cage winding—currents that increase in magnitude as the rotor speed rises. The magnetic field produced by these induced currents interacts with the rotating magnetic field, creating a torque on the stator that acts in the same direction as the rotor’s rotation. Consequently, the higher the rotor speed, the greater the resulting torque. When the rotor is stationary, the stator remains in a stable central position due to the gravitational force acting on the stator holder. Once the rotor starts rotating, the stator experiences a torque that causes it to turn in the same direction as the rotor. The higher the rotor speed, the greater the clockwise torque exerted on the stator, resulting in a larger rotational angle. After the stator reaches a certain angle, the normally closed contacts open, while the normally open contacts close. When the shaft speed drops close to zero (below 100 r/min), the contacts automatically reset to their original positions. Commonly used speed relays include the JY1 series and the JF20 series. The JY1 series can reliably operate at speeds up to 3600 r/min, whereas the JF20-1 model is suitable for applications with speeds ranging from 300 to 1000 r/min, and the JF20-2 model is designed for speeds between 1000 and 3600 r/min. Typically, the relay resets when the speed drops to around 120 r/min. Common faults, their underlying causes, and recommended repair methods for speed relays are summarized in Table 5.3.

If you notice asphalt-like material leaking from the porcelain base (as in the case of RC1A fuses), it indicates either an overload or poor contact at the connections—especially at copper-aluminum joints—as well as inadequate contact between the blade and its socket. Address these issues promptly. (4) Check whether the contact between the fuse element and the blade, between the blade and the blade holder, and between the spiral fuse element itself is good. Poor contact can lead to overheating, resulting in false tripping. (5) After the fuse element of a cartridge-type fuse blows, inspect the inner wall of the steel-paper fuse tube for signs of burning. If the inner wall is burned, arc extinction will no longer be reliable, so the fuse should be replaced promptly with a new one. (6) Verify that the load matches the rated value of the fuse. (7) Check the ambient temperature where the fuse is used; excessively high temperatures can cause false tripping. (8) When a short circuit or severe overload occurs in the circuit or load, the fuse fails to cut off the power supply. In such cases, check whether a copper wire has been blindly substituted for the fuse element. It is strictly prohibited to use copper wire as a substitute for the fuse element. (9) When a fuse melts, do not immediately put the system back into operation after replacing it with a new one. Instead, first analyze the cause of the fuse failure, identify and repair the underlying fault before resuming operation. Otherwise, there is a risk of damaging electrical equipment and even causing arc flash incidents that could injure personnel.

This is typically caused by either loose crimping, a loosened screw, or a rusted and seized screw.

As shown in Figure 5.6(b), the exposed portion of the  fuse has almost entirely undergone explosive melting, with only the screw-pressed area remaining intact.

597,"Common button malfunctions and repair methods are as follows. (1) A tingling sensation is felt when pressing the start button. ① The button's protective metal casing is in contact with the energized connecting wires; simply check the internal wire connections and remove any short circuit caused by the contact with the casing. ② On metal cutting machine tools, iron chips or metal powder can get lodged between the button cap and its surrounding gaps, creating an electrical path that leads to a tingling or electric shock sensation. To eliminate this issue, regularly clean the area, or install a plastic film cover over the buttons to prevent metal debris from entering. (2) The circuit must not be disconnected when the stop button is pressed. Typically, this occurs because the normally open contact of the stop button has developed an abnormal short circuit—meaning that whether the stop button is pressed or not, the contacts remain connected, naturally preventing the circuit from breaking. This abnormal short circuit arises due to two main factors: ① metal shavings or oil The dirty short has bridged the normally open contact; simply clean it off to remove the issue. ② The bakelite in the button box is burnt and carbonized, causing a short circuit in the normally open contact. (3) When the stop button is pressed and then the start button, the controlled appliance does not operate. Typically, this is caused by a damaged reset spring in the stop button, which prevents the normally closed contact from returning to its original position after the stop button is pressed, leaving it permanently open and causing the control circuit to lose power. This issue can be resolved by simply replacing the reset spring. Additionally, oxidation of the normally open contact on the start button—leading to poor electrical contact—can also result in the same malfunction.

Limit Switch A limit switch, also known as a position switch or travel switch, operates its contacts not by direct manual manipulation but through the collision of moving mechanical components.  As a result, a limit switch is a switching device that converts mechanical travel signals into electrical signals, making it widely used in sequence controllers as well as automat ed systems designed for motion direction, stroke control, positioning, limit detection, and safety applications. Common faults associated with limit switches are described below. ( 1) If the limit switch is triggered, the equipment will operate uncontrollably. This type of failure poses significant risks, as it prevents the limit switch from properly controll ing travel and positioning, potentially leading to accidents such as personal injury or equipment damage. To address this issue, troubleshooting can be approached from several angl es: ① Poor contact at the switch contacts is a common cause of malfunction during normal operation. Regular inspection and cleaning of the limit switch are essential to ensure its con tacts maintain optimal connectivity. ② The limit switch or stop block itself may be improperly installed; alternatively, frequent operational impacts could have loosened and shifte d the mounting screws of the limit switch or stop block. As a result, even when the switch roller (or actuating post) comes into contact with the limit switch, it fails to effectiv ely push the contacts into their intended positions—either fully on or off. In such cases, the position of the limit switch or stop block should be adjusted, and the mounting screw s must be securely tightened. ③ The contact wire is loose—check and tighten the loose connection. (2) After the limit switch is reset, the normally closed contact fails to close. I f this fault occurs, promptly remove the limit switch and begin your inspection from the following aspects. ① If the reset spring of the normally open contact has weakened or is bl ocked by debris, replace the spring or remove the obstruction. ② The normally open contact is skewed or has come loose. Such misalignment or detachment typically occurs when the li mit switch is installed too close to the impact block, leading to excessive pushing force during collisions. Therefore, when troubleshooting this issue, be sure to adjust the insta llation position of the limit switch appropriately. (3) The lever has already tilted, but the contact point remains inactive. This issue typically occurs because the limit switch i s installed too low; to resolve this, you can either add a shim beneath the limit switch base or raise its installation position. Additionally, mechanical jamming inside the limit  switch itself can also lead to the failure. In such cases, inspect and clean the switch thoroughly, reassemble and adjust it properly, and apply a small amount of machine oil to th e moving pivot points to ensure smooth operation and eliminate any mechanical obstructions. 5.6 Sensor Fault Diagnosis",text-EN.txt
600,"Modern mechanical manufacturing systems are characterized by  their large-scale control, high levels of automation, and strong flexibility. As the structure of these manufacturing systems becomes increasingly complex, demands for cost control  and production continuity continue to rise—making any downtime caused by various types of failures an unacceptable burden. Consequently, fault diagnosis systems have seen rapid ad vancements, with technologies now including the use of advanced sensors to capture diverse physical parameters during processes, enabling seamless signal transmission and processin g. By analyzing these processed signals, operators can monitor the operational status of production equipment and assess product quality in real time, while also predicting future  trends, diagnosing faults, and triggering timely alerts. Currently, fault analysis methods used in mechanical production systems can be applied to automated production lines, CNC machine tools, flexible manufacturing cells, and even larger systems such as computer-integrated manufacturing systems. Automated production lines are far more complex than individual pieces of equipment, making it challenging to quickly pinpoint the root cause and exact location of a problem. To enhance overall system efficiency, in addition to improving equipment reliability, it is often essential—under certain conditions—to introduce advanced fault diagnosis systems into automated production lines. 1. Errors Introduced by the Sensor Sensor-generated errors can be categorized into five basic types: insertion error, application error, characteristic error, and dynamic error. Chapter 5: Fault Diagnosis and Repair of Electrical Systems 163 Difference and environmental error. (1) Insertion error. It occurs when a sensor is inserted into the system, causing errors due to changes in the measured parameters. This kind of issue typically arises during electronic measurements, but similar problems can also occur in other types of measurements. (2) Application error. This is caused by the operator and can arise from various factors. For instance, it may occur during temperature measurements. Errors include incorrect probe placement or improper insulation between the probe and the measurement point. Additionally, some application errors arise during the purification process of air or other gases. Application errors also involve misplacement of the transmitter, which can lead to inaccurate readings due to either positive or negative pressure affecting the measurement. (3) Characteristic error. This is inherent to the device itself and represents the discrepancy between the device’s ideal, well-established transfer function characteristics and its actual performance. Such errors include DC drift values (e.g., incorrect pressure head). (4) Dynamic Error. Many sensors exhibit strong damping, which prevents them from responding quickly to changes in input parameters. For instance, a thermistor may take several seconds to react to a step change in temperature, meaning it won’t instantly jump to a new impedance or produce an abrupt shift. Instead, it gradually adjusts to the new value over time. If a sensor with inherent delay characteristics attempts to respond rapidly to a sudden temperature change, the resulting output waveform will become distorted, as it will include dynamic error. Factors contributing to dynamic error include response time, amplitude distortion, and phase distortion. (5) Environmental errors. These arise from the environment in which the sensor is used and include factors such as temperature, sway, vibration, altitude, chemical vaporization, or other influences. Such factors often affect the sensor's performance, which is why, in practical applications, they are typically categorized and addressed collectively.",text-EN.txt
601,2. Interference During Sensor Operation and Corresponding Mitigation Measures,text-EN.txt
602,"1) Anti-Interference Design for Power Supply Systems The most severe threat to the normal operation of sensors comes from power grid spike pulse interference. Devices that generate these spikes include electric welders, large electri c motors, variable-frequency drives, relay contactors, and even items like electric soldering irons. Spike interference can be effectively suppressed using a combination of hardwar e and software solutions. (1) Use hardware circuits to suppress spike interference. Common methods include the following three approaches: ① Insert an interference controller in series at the AC power input of the instrument; ② Install a super-isolation transformer at the AC power input of the instrument, leveraging the principle of ferromagnetic resonance to dampen spike pulses; ③ Connect a varistor in parallel at the AC power input of the instrument, utilizing the property that its resistance decreases sharply when spike pulses arrive, thereby reducing t he voltage drawn by the instrument from the power supply and mitigating the impact of interference. (2) Suppress spike interference using software methods. For periodic interferenc e, programming-based time filtering can be employed to effectively eliminate the disturbance. (3) Employ a hardware-and-software combined watchdog technology to suppress the effect s of spike pulses. (4) Implement grouped power supply systems. For example, separate the power supply for driving electric motors from the control power supply to prevent interfere nce between devices. (5) Using a noise filter can also effectively suppress interference from the AC servo drive to other equipment. (6) Use an isolation transformer to enhance imm unity against common-mode interference. (7) Employ a power supply with high anti-interference performance, such as a high-anti-interference power supply designed using the spectrum  equalization method. 2) Anti-Interference Design for Signal Transmission Channels (1) Optoelectronic coupling isolation measures. During long-distance transmission, using optocoup lers can break the electrical connection between the control system and the input/output channels, as well as between the servo driver's input/output circuits. The primary advantag e of optoelectronic coupling is its ability to effectively suppress spike pulses and various noise interferences, significantly improving the signal-to-noise ratio during signal tr ansmission. Despite these interference noises, this technique is invaluable in fault diagnosis and maintenance case studies for electromechanical systems. 164 However, it has a lar ge voltage amplitude but very little energy, resulting in only a weak current. Meanwhile, the light-emitting diode in the input section of the optocoupler operates in a current-dri ven mode, typically requiring a forward current of 10–15 mA. Therefore, even if there are significant interference signals, they will be effectively suppressed because they cannot  provide sufficient current to overcome the system's inherent limitations. (2) Twisted-shielded cable transmission. During transmission, signals are susceptible to interference from factors such as electric fields, magnetic fields, and ground impedance. Using a grounded shielded cable can effectively reduce the impact of electric-field interference. Compared to coaxial cables, twisted-shielded cables have a narrower frequency bandwidth but offer higher wave impedance and superior immunity to common-mode noise, enabling electromagnetic induction interference across individual segments to cancel each other out. Additionally, differential signal transmission is typically employed for long-distance communication, further enhancing the system's resistance to external interference. 3) Elimination of Locally Generated Errors In low-level measurements, careful attention must be paid to the materials used—or incorporated—within the signal path. Even in simple circuits, components like solder, wires, and terminal blocks can introduce significant thermoelectric effects due to temperature differences. Since thermoelectric voltages often occur in pairs, it’s highly effective to ensure that these paired thermocouples remain at the same temperature. To achieve this, techniques such as thermal shielding, arranging heat sinks along isothermal lines, or separating high-power and low-power circuits are commonly employed—each aimed at minimizing thermal gradients. While connectors, sockets, and relays offer convenience for easily swapping electrical components or modules, they also come with drawbacks: they can introduce contact resistance, thermoelectric voltages, or both. As a result, these compromises often lead to reduced stability in low-level resolution—meaning the system becomes less precise, more prone to noise, and less reliable compared to directly connected setups. Therefore, in low-level amplification circuits, it’s crucial to avoid using switches, connectors, and similar elements whenever possible. This practice is one of the most important strategies for minimizing failures and enhancing measurement accuracy. 3. Common Transmitter Faults and Their Causes",text-EN.txt
603,Common faults and their causes of the transmitter are shown in Table 5.5. Table 5.5: Common Transmitter Faults and Their Causes,text-EN.txt

No power output or power mismatch Transmitter contact No output Sensor damaged",text-EN.txt
605,"4. Methods for Handling Inaccurate Positioning in Inductive Proximity Switches Proximity switches are primarily used for positioning, and sometimes also for counting movements. They feature a signal indicator light on their rear end, which illuminates when a metallic object approaches within 15 mm of the switch’s sensing area—simultaneously triggering the corresponding input port LED on the PLC to light up. Conversely, when the metal object moves away, the signal indicator light turns off, and the associated input port LED on the PLC goes dark as well. When performing the inspection, first wipe away any water or dust from the sensor. Then, repeatedly bring a metal object (such as a screwdriver or wrench) close to the sensor's end and observe whether the signal indicator light flashes. Afterward, move the sampling device so that the sensor is positioned directly facing the induction block. Chapter 5: Fault Diagnosis and Repair of the Electrical System 165 Place the sensor and check whether the gap between them is too large (it should not exceed 15 mm), as an excessive gap may prevent the sensor from reliably detecting and sending a signal. If the sensor’s output signal is abnormal, first verify that the signal wiring is functioning properly—start by ensuring the sensor’s power supply is working correctly, then check whether the signal cable connected to the PLC is intact and operational. 5. Errors Due to Improper Thermocouple Usage",text-EN.txt
606,"Errors introduced by improper installation The location and insertion depth of the thermocouple must not reflect the actual furnace temperature. In other words, the thermocouple should not be installed too close to the door or heating elements, and its insertion depth should be at least 8 to 10 times the diameter of the protective sheath. If the thermocouple's protective sheath Failure to fill the gap between the thermocouple protection tube and the furnace wall opening with insulating material will allow heat to escape from the furnace or cold air to infiltrate, leading to inaccurate temperature measurements due to convective heat transfer. Therefore, the space between the thermocouple protection tube and the furnace wall opening should be properly sealed using fire-resistant mortar or asbestos rope—materials that provide effective insulation—to prevent unwanted air circulation and maintain measurement accuracy. Additionally, when installing thermocouples, it’s crucial to avoid areas exposed to strong magnetic or electric fields. For instance, thermocouples should never be routed inside the same conduit as power cables, as this could introduce electromagnetic interference and cause measurement errors. Moreover, thermocouples should not be installed in regions where the medium being measured experiences minimal flow, as this can compromise their ability to accurately reflect temperature changes. When using a thermocouple to measure gas temperatures inside a pipe, ensure that the thermocouple is installed against the direction of gas flow, allowing maximum contact with the gas for precise readings. 2) Errors Introduced by Deteriorated Insulation After being used for a period of time, thermocouples may develop excessive dirt or salt deposits on their protective sheaths and lead plates, leading to poor insulation between the thermocouple junctions and the furnace walls—especially under high-temperature conditions. This not only causes significant loss of thermoelectric voltage but also introduces unwanted interference, resulting in temperature errors that can sometimes reach as high as hundreds of degrees Celsius. 3) Errors Introduced by Thermal Inertia Due to the thermal inertia of thermocouples, the instrument's reading lags behind changes in the measured temperature—this effect is particularly pronounced during rapid measurements. Therefore, it’s best to use thermocouples with thinner thermoelements and smaller-diameter protective sheaths whenever possible. If the measurement environment permits, the protective sheath can even be removed entirely. To ensure accurate temperature readings, thermocouples with a small time constant should be selected. The time constant is inversely proportional to the heat transfer coefficient and directly proportional to the diameter of the thermocouple's hot junction, as well as the material's density and specific heat. To minimize the time constant, the most effective approach—not only by enhancing the heat transfer coefficient—is to reduce the size of the hot junction as much as possible. In practice, protective sheaths made from materials with excellent thermal conductivity, featuring thin walls and small inner diameters, are commonly used. 4) Thermal Resistance Error At high temperatures, if a layer of coal ash or dust adheres to the protective sheath, thermal resistance increases, impeding heat conduction. As a result, the temperature reading will be lower than the actual temperature being measured. Therefore, it’s important to keep the exterior of the thermocouple protective sheath clean. 5.7 Common Faults of Electromagnetic Flow Meters",text-EN.txt
607,"Common faults in electromagnetic flowmeters can result either from damage to the instrument's internal components or from improper selection, incorrect installation, adverse environmental conditions, and fluid characteristics—leading to issues such as display fluctuations, reduced accuracy, or even complete instrument failure. These faults are generally categorized into two types: those that occur during installation and commissioning (commissioning-phase faults) and those that arise during normal operation (operation-phase faults). 1. Debugging Phase Faults Debugging-phase failures typically occur during the instrument installation and commissioning stage, but once resolved, they generally do not reappear under the same conditions afterward. Common debugging-phase faults are usually caused by improper installation, environmental interference, and the influence of fluid characteristics. Mechatronic System Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance Case Study Tutorial",text-EN.txt
608,"166 (1) Installation issues. These typically stem from incorrect placement of the electromagnetic flow sensor—common mistakes include installing the sensor at the highest point of a piping system where gas tends to accumulate, or mounting it on a vertical pipe flowing downward, which may lead to drainage problems. Another frequent issue is failing to maintain backpressure downstream of the sensor, allowing the fluid to vent directly into the atmosphere and resulting in an unfilled measuring tube. (2) Environmental factors. These typically include stray pipeline currents, strong electromagnetic interference from the surrounding environment, and magnetic field interference from large electric motors. Stray pipeline currents can usually be effectively addressed by implementing proper, independent grounding protection. Electromagnetic interference from external sources often enters via signal cables, and this is typically mitigated through single- or multi-layer shielding. (3) Fluid aspects: The presence of uniformly distributed tiny air bubbles in the liquid being measured typically does not affect the normal operation of the electromagnetic flowmeter. However, as the bubbles grow larger, fluctuations may appear in the instrument's output signal. If the bubbles become large enough to completely cover the electrode surface, their passage over the electrodes can cause the electrode circuit to momentarily break, leading to even greater fluctuations in the output signal. 2. Runtime Faults Runtime failures occur after an electromagnetic flowmeter has been properly calibrated and has been operating normally for a period of time. Common runtime issues are typically caused by factors such as deposits on the inner walls of the flow sensor, lightning strikes, and changes in environmental conditions. (1) Deposits on the Inner Wall of the Flow Sensor. Since electromagnetic flowmeters are often used to measure dirty or contaminated fluids, after a period of operation, deposits frequently accumulate on the inner walls of the flow sensor, leading to malfunctions. These issues typically arise when the conductivity of the deposited layer is either too high or too low. If the deposit acts as an insulating layer, it causes an open circuit in the electrode loop, preventing the instrument from functioning properly. Conversely, if the deposit has significantly higher conductivity than the fluid itself, it results in a short circuit in the electrode loop, also disrupting normal operation. Therefore, it’s crucial to promptly remove any buildup on the inner wall of the electromagnetic flowmeter’s sensor. (2) Lightning strikes. Lightning strikes can easily induce high voltages and surge currents in instrument wiring, leading to equipment damage. These effects are primarily introduced via power lines, excitation coils, or the flow signal cables connecting sensors to transmitters—and most commonly, through the power lines entering the control room. (3) Changes in environmental conditions. During debugging, the electromagnetic flowmeter operated normally because the environmental conditions were still favorable. However, this often leads to neglecting proper installation requirements (such as inadequate grounding). Under these circumstances, once the environmental conditions change—perhaps due to new sources of interference emerging during operation (e.g., electric welding performed on nearby pipelines or the installation of large transformers in close proximity)—the instrument’s normal functioning can be disrupted, causing fluctuations in the flowmeter’s output signal. 5.8 Fault Diagnosis of Electric Motors and Their Control Systems",text-EN.txt
609,"Proper Use of Electric Motors Operating Conditions Proper selection and correct operation of electric motors are two critical steps to ensure their reliable performance, and proper usage should meet the following three operational conditions. (1) Power supply conditions: The power supply voltage, frequency, and number of phases must match the motor’s nameplate specifications. The power supply should be a balanced system, with voltage deviations not exceeding ±5% (when operating at rated frequency), and frequency deviations limited to no more than ±1% (when voltage is at its rated value). (2) Environmental conditions: The ambient temperature at the motor's operating location must not exceed 40°C, making it suitable for use in well-ventilated, dry indoor environments. (3) Load conditions. The motor's performance should accommodate starting, braking, various rated loads, as well as load variations or speed control requirements. Ensure compatibility with the conditions; when in use, the load should not exceed the motor's rated power. Chapter 5: Fault Diagnosis and Repair of Electrical Systems 167",text-EN.txt
610,"Important Notes Maintenance during normal operation should pay attention to the following points. (1) The temperature of the motor during normal operation should not exceed the permissible limit. During operation, on-duty personnel should regularly monitor and observe the temperature rise in each component. (2) Monitor the motor load current. Both motor overload and motor failure can cause a sharp increase in stator current, leading to overheating of the motor. All electrical equipment should be equipped with an ammeter to monitor the motor load current; under normal operation, the motor load current should not exceed the rated current value specified on the nameplate. (3) Monitor changes in power supply voltage and frequency, as well as voltage imbalance. Both excessively high or low voltage and frequency levels, along with three-phase voltage imbalances, can lead to current imbalance, potentially causing motor overheating or other abnormal conditions. The current imbalance should not exceed 10%. (4) Pay attention to the motor's smell, vibration, and noise. Overheating of the windings will produce a burning odor. Some faults—especially mechanical ones—quickly manifest as vibrations and noise; therefore, if you detect a burning smell or notice abnormal vibrations, friction sounds, excessively loud humming, or any other unusual noises, immediately disconnect the power and perform an inspection. (5) Regularly check bearings for overheating and oil leaks, and replace the lubricant on a scheduled basis. For rolling bearings, the grease should not exceed 70% of the bearing housing volume. (6) For wound-rotor motors, check the contact between the brushes and the slip rings, as well as brush wear and sparking conditions. If sparking is severe, promptly clean the surface of the slip rings and adjust the brush spring pressure accordingly. (7) Ensure the inside of the motor remains clean—no water droplets, oil stains, or debris should be allowed to enter. The motor's air intake must remain completely unobstructed.",text-EN.txt
611,"Causes of Excessive Motor Temperature Rise and Corresponding Solutions (1) Long-term motor overload. When a motor is overloaded, the current flowing through each winding exceeds th e rated current, leading to overheating. If the load is not adjusted promptly, the insulation performance of the windings will deteriorate, eventually causing short circuits or gro und faults that prevent the motor from operating properly. (2) Operation not in accordance with regulations. Electric motors must be operated as specified—for example,  ""short-time "" and  ""intermittent "" motors cannot run continuously, since their winding wire gauges and rated currents are smaller than those of motors designed for long-term operation. (3) Armature winding short c ircuit. This can be checked using a short-circuit detector. If the short occurs on the outside of the winding, insulation wrapping can be applied; however, if the short is inside t he winding, the winding must, in principle, be removed and rewound. (4) Open circuit in the main pole winding. The winding can be checked using a test lamp. If the break occurs out side the winding, reconnect it securely and insulate the area properly. However, if the break is inside the winding, the winding must be removed and rewound entirely. (5) The grid  voltage is too low, or the line voltage drop is excessive (exceeding 10%). For example, poor contact somewhere in the motor’s main circuit—or a grid voltage that’s too low—can sign ificantly reduce the motor’s electromagnetic torque, leading to motor overload. In such cases, the main circuit should be inspected to eliminate any contact issues, or the grid vol tage should be adjusted accordingly. (6) Insufficient ventilation. For example, if the blower’s air volume or velocity is inadequate, the motor may overheat due to trapped internal  heat that cannot be dissipated. In such cases, the appropriate ventilation equipment should be replaced. (7) The rotation direction of the inclined-blade fan is incorrect and does  not match the motor. In this case, the inclined-blade fan should be adjusted to ensure proper alignment with the motor. Theoretically, most motors can rotate in both forward and r everse directions; however, some motors have fans that are designed for a specific rotation direction—reversing the fan could cause the temperature rise to exceed safe limits signi ficantly. (8) Armature core insulation damage. In this case, the insulation should be replaced.",text-EN.txt

Faults in Three-Phase Induction Motors During Operation and Their Main Causes While in operation, the motor should be regularly inspected to promptly identify and address any faults—otherwise, these issues could lead to accidents. Below are the most common failures and their underlying causes. 1) Mechanical failure (1) Overheating of the bearing. This may be caused by insufficient or excessive grease, shaft misalignment, excessive shaft friction, impurities and foreign objects in the grease, or damage to the steel balls, among other reasons. (2) Motor vibration. This may be caused by misalignment of the unit’s shaft, improper positioning of the motor on the baseplate, bending of the rotating shaft or journal bearing vibrations, poor coupling alignment, imbalance in the rotor pulley and coupling, broken bars or open circuits in the squirrel-cage rotor, vibration of the rotor core, uneven settlement of the baseplate, insufficient baseplate rigidity, or when the baseplate’s vibration frequency matches—or closely resembles—the motor (unit)’s natural vibration frequency. Other contributing factors include roughness of the pulleys or incorrect installation of the pulley system, as well as malfunctioning or collision issues within the rotating mechanism. (3) Rotor eccentricity. This can be caused by issues such as loose shaft liners, bearing displacement, deformation of the rotor and stator cores, shaft bending, and poor rotor balance. 2) Electrical malfunction (1) Faults during startup.

615,"4. Common Abnormalities in Running Electric Motors and Their Troubleshooting Methods (1) Abnormal Noi se. In a normally functioning motor, when standing at a slightly farther distance, you’ll hear a consistent, monotonous sound accompanied by a faint exhaust noise. However, as you  move closer to the motor—especially when gently pressing a screwdriver against various parts—you can clearly distinguish the fan’s exhaust sound, the smooth rolling of the bearings , and even a subtle vibration. These sounds, too, feel consistently uniform and repetitive. If, amidst this steady, even background noise, an unusual or irregular sound emerges, th at’s what we call abnormal noise. (2) Odor. If you detect a burning smell coming from the motor while it’s running, it indicates that the motor is already malfunctioning and immedi ate action should be taken. (3) Abnormal current and temperature. The motor's operating current should not exceed the value specified on its nameplate, and the three-phase current  imbalance should remain within 10%. Additionally, temperature rises at all components must stay within permissible limits (bearing Class A: 60°C, Class E: 55°C); otherwise, appropr iate measures should be taken as necessary. Necessary measures. (4) Voltage Abnormality. When the motor is running normally, the three-phase voltages rise and fall simultaneously,  fluctuating between 353 and 406 V. If the three-phase voltages increase unevenly, it indicates a fault has occurred and requires inspection and troubleshooting.

The wiring should be corrected. 2) Causes of Excessive No-Load Current  in Electric Motors and Corresponding Solutions (1) Overvoltage in the power supply causes the iron core to saturate, increasing residual magnetism and leading to a rise in no-load  current. The power supply voltage should be checked and addressed accordingly. (2) The motor itself has a large air gap or worn-out bearings, resulting in uneven air gaps. The mot or should be disassembled, and an internal/external caliper used to measure the stator inner diameter and rotor outer diameter. Adjust the clearance or replace the bearings with co mponents of the appropriate specifications. (3) The motor stator winding has fewer turns than it should. The stator winding should be rewound to increase the number of turns. (4) T he motor stator windings should be connected in a Y configuration, but they were mistakenly wired in a Δ configuration. Please inspect the stator wiring and compare it with the nam eplate data, then correct the wiring accordingly. (5) During maintenance, turning the rotor increased the air gap, resulting in a noticeable rise in no-load current. The rotor shou ld be replaced after being turned. (6) During maintenance, if the slots in the stator and rotor cores are widened, the no-load current will increase. The stator and rotor should be  replaced. (7) Using different slot wedges during maintenance may increase the no-load current. It is recommended to revert to the original specification of slot wedges. (8) Improp er adjustment of the mechanical components increases mechanical resistance, leading to a higher no-load current. The mechanical parts can be adjusted accordingly. 11. Reasons for a nd Solutions to Excessive or Insufficient Speed with Severe Sparking After a DC Motor Starts After a DC motor starts, if the speed is too high or too low and accompanied by severe  sparking, it’s usually caused by the following reasons, which can be addressed accordingly. Chapter 5: Fault Diagnosis and Repair of Electrical Systems, p. 171 (1) The brushes are  misaligned and not in their normal position. You can reconfigure the brushes according to the original markings, or adjust their position using the induction method.",text-EN.txt
622,"(2) Excessive  resistance in the field winding circuit. Check all connections in the field winding circuit for oxidation layers that may cause poor contact; if present, gently sand them down usin g fine-grit sandpaper. Additionally, disassemble the motor and verify whether the voltage across the field winding is within the normal range. If it’s abnormal, identify and addres s any faults in the associated wiring circuit. (3) The armature and field windings have short-circuit or open-circuit points. Disassemble the motor, separate the wiring connectors,  and individually inspect each coil group in the field winding for short circuits or open circuits. Repair or replace the affected coils as needed. (4) The series motor is running  under too light a load. After inspection, if the series motor exhibits abnormal speed when lightly loaded—and assuming there are no faults in the wiring—adjust by appropriately inc reasing the motor's load. (5) The series-field winding is connected in reverse. Check the wiring of the series-field winding and reconnect it correctly according to the proper proc edure. 12. Excitation Protection and Overload Protection for DC Motors The control circuit for a DC motor, like that of an AC motor, also requires numerous protective features, such as s hort-circuit protection, overvoltage and undervoltage protection, speed-limiting protection, field protection, and overload protection. Some of these protective measures are identi cal to those used in AC control circuits. Below, we’ll focus on the commonly employed field protection and overload protection found in DC control systems. (1) Field Excitation Pro tection. During the operation of a DC motor, if the voltage in the field circuit drops or is suddenly cut off, This will cause the motor speed to rise sharply—a phenomenon commonly  known as  ""runaway. "" To prevent  ""runaway "" incidents, an undercurrent relay coil can be connected in series within the excitation circuit, with the normally closed contact of the undercurrent relay wired in series in the  control circuit. When the current in the excitation circuit is normal, the undercurrent relay's normally closed contact remains closed, keeping the control circuit energized. Howev er, if the excitation circuit loses power or the current drops too low, the undercurrent relay’s normally closed contact immediately opens, cutting off power to the motor and provi ding crucial protection for the excitation system. (2) Overload Protection. During the operation of a DC motor, the current in the armature winding circuit typically fluctuates sig nificantly—especially during startup, reversing, and braking processes, where large overload currents can occur. If these currents are not limited or protected against, the motor c ould easily overheat and burn out. To ensure the proper functioning of the DC motor-driven system and prevent damage from excessive currents, an overcurrent relay coil is usually c onnected in series within the armature winding circuit. The normally closed contact of the overcurrent relay is then wired in series with the control circuit. When the current in t he armature winding circuit exceeds the safe limit, the relay’s normally closed contact immediately activates, cutting off the control circuit and disconnecting the motor from the  power supply—thus providing effective overload protection. 13. Low-Speed Operation of DC Motors and Methods for Reducing Speed and Reversing Rotation Direction",text-EN.txt
623,"Generally speaking,  if a DC motor operates at low speed, it will lead to increased temperature rise and cause several adverse effects. However, by implementing measures to improve ventilation—such as  enhancing the motor's cooling capacity—one can enable the DC motor to run continuously at low speeds without exceeding its rated temperature rise. Taking a shunt DC motor as an exa mple, the following three methods can be used to reduce its speed. (1) Reducing the terminal voltage. Since the supply voltage is typically fixed and difficult to change—and loweri ng the terminal voltage would also reduce the excitation current, which in turn causes the motor speed to increase—this method is rarely employed. (2) Increasing the excitation cur rent means boosting the magnetic field strength. However, due to limitations imposed by magnetic circuit saturation—and because it’s difficult to raise the supply voltage—the inher ent resistance of the excitation winding cannot be altered. As a result, this method has limited practical applications. (3) By connecting a resistor in series within the armature  circuit, the armature terminal voltage is reduced. This method is the simplest and easiest to implement, making it one of the most commonly used techniques for lowering the speed o f DC motors. Many machines require motors that can rotate both forward and backward. Changing the direction of rotation in a DC motor essentially involves revising the electromecha nical system—fault diagnosis and repair case studies tutorial. 172 By reversing the direction of its electromagnetic torque. And the direction of the electromagnetic torque primari ly depends on the direction of the main magnetic flux and the direction of the armature current—both Changing any one of them can reverse the direction of the electromagnetic torqu e. Here's how: (1) By swapping the two wire terminals connected to the excitation winding’s power supply, you reverse the direction of the excitation winding current—and thus reverse the direction of the magnetic field. In practical applications, however, since DC motors typically have a large number of turns in their excitation windings, resulting in high inductance, disconnecting the excitation winding from the power source can generate a significant self-induced electromotive force. This, in turn, causes substantial sparking at the switching contacts and may even lead to breakdown of the insulation layer in the excitation winding. Therefore, for DC motors requiring frequent reversals, it is common practice to instead reverse the direction of the armature current as a more reliable method to achieve motor reversal. (2) Reverse the direction of the current in the armature winding. This method involves keeping the direction of the current in the field winding unchanged while reversing the direction of the armature current, thereby causing the motor to rotate in the opposite direction. Figure 5.7 illustrates the forward/reverse control wiring for switching the direction of the armature winding current. In the diagram, KM1 is the contactor for forward rotation of the motor, and KM2 is the contactor for reverse rotation. If you need the motor to rotate forward, press the forward-start button SB2—this will energize the coil of KM1, causing its normally open main contacts to close. As a result, the motor armature connects to the DC power supply, and current flows upward through the armature winding, initiating forward rotation. If you want the motor to reverse direction, first press the stop button SB1, which de-energizes and releases the coil of KM1, opening its contacts and disconnecting the armature from the DC power supply, thus stopping the motor. Next, press the reverse-start button SB3, energizing the coil of the reverse contactor KM2 and closing its normally open main contacts. This reconnects the armature to the DC power supply, but now the current flows downward through the armature winding instead of upward as in forward rotation. By reversing the direction of the armature current, the motor begins to rotate in the opposite direction to its original forward motion. Figure 5.7: Forward and Reverse Control Circuit for Reversing the Armature Winding Current Direction To prevent simultaneously pressing buttons SB1 and SB2, which would cause the coils of KM1 and KM2 to energize at the same time—leading to their normally open contacts closing simultaneously and potentially resulting in a short circuit in the main circuit—a normally closed contact for both KM1 and KM2 is incorporated into the control circuit, providing interlocking (or mutual locking) functionality. When reversing the direction of rotation in a shunt motor with commutating poles, pay attention to the polarity of the commutating poles. If you reverse the direction of the armature current, the direction of the current in the commutating pole winding must also be reversed simultaneously. However, if you reverse the direction of the field winding current, neither the armature winding nor the commutating pole winding currents need to change.",text-EN.txt
624,"14. Methods for Handling High, Low, or Unstable Speeds in DC Motor Operation",text-EN.txt
625,"When operating a DC motor, if you notice that the speed is too high, too low, or unstable, you can perform the following checks and take appropriate actions. (1) Excessive speed. The speed of a DC motor is influenced by both the supply voltage and the main magnetic flux. When the supply voltage is normal, an unusually high motor speed could indicate either an inter-turn short circuit in the field winding or, during maintenance, incorrect polarity connections on individual main poles—both of which reduce the main magnetic flux and thus cause the speed to rise. Additionally, if the field winding or the field circuit experiences an open-circuit failure, only residual magnetism remains in the main poles. In such cases, the speed of a separately excited (shunt-connected) motor will surge dramatically. If the load is light, this could lead to a ""runaway"" condition; however, even with a heavier load, while a ""runaway"" may be avoided, the armature current could still increase to dangerously high levels. Failure to immediately disconnect the power supply under these circumstances could result in severe damage. Chapter 5: Fault Diagnosis and Repair of Electrical Systems",text-EN.txt
626,173,text-EN.txt
627,"The motor will soon overheat and burn out. In the situation described above, you should carefully check whether the excitation winding current is normal and whether the polarity of each winding has been reversed. (2) Low rotational speed. When the supply voltage is normal, a low motor speed may indicate that the series-wound field winding is connected in reverse, or that there are poor connections at various points in the armature circuit and inadequate contact at the brushes—both of which can lead to excessive resistance drops in the armature circuit, resulting in reduced speed. Additionally, it’s important to consider the motor’s load conditions; if the load is too heavy, causing an increase in current, this can also lead to higher resistance drops in the circuit, ultimately lowering the motor’s speed. (3) Unstable RPM. During operation, the motor experiences unstable rotational speed; typically, this is due to one of two reasons. ① Fluctuations in the power supply voltage or improper adjustments to control system parameters can cause the motor speed to vary—sometimes speeding up, sometimes slowing down—and in severe cases, even lead to motor oscillations. To address this issue, first check whether the supply voltages in the armature circuit and excitation circuit are stable. If the power supply voltage is fluctuating significantly, the primary step should be to eliminate any faults in the power source itself. Power supply voltage fluctuations often stem from incorrect parameter settings in the speed control system; therefore, the relevant parameters should be adjusted carefully based on the specific situation. ② Internal faults within the motor, such as brushes being off-center or incorrect polarity connections in the series-wound and commutating-pole windings, can all lead to significant speed fluctuations when the load changes. If the motor speed remains unstable despite a normal power supply voltage, the issue is likely due to an internal motor fault. In this case, carefully check whether the polarity of each winding’s connecting wires is correct, and adjust the brush neutral position accordingly. Additionally, observe whether there are any sparking at the brushes or noticeable changes in armature current, as these observations can help pinpoint the exact cause of the problem. 5.9 Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) Fault Diagnosis",text-EN.txt
628,"Normal Operating Conditions for the PLC Although PLCs are industrial control devices specifically designed for use in harsh industrial environments, they still have certain requirements for their operating conditions. Therefore, when installing, maintaining, and performing routine inspections, you can consider the following aspects. (1) Temperature: Generally, PLCs require an operating environment temperature between 0°C and 55°C, with storage temperatures ranging from -40°C to 85°C. Therefore, during installation, avoid placing the PLC directly above components that generate significant heat, and ensure adequate clearance around the PLC to facilitate proper ventilation and heat dissipation. If conditions permit, you can install a fan inside the control cabinet and use a filter screen to draw in ambient air, helping to reduce the overall working environment temperature. In colder operating environments, consider installing a heater within the control cabinet and equipping it with a suitable temperature sensor. This setup will enable the system to automatically power on when temperatures drop below a certain threshold and shut off automatically when temperatures rise too high. (2) Humidity. To ensure the insulation performance of the PLC, the relative humidity of the operating environment should generally be between 10% and 90%. However, PLCs should not be installed in areas where temperatures change rapidly or where condensation is likely to occur. (3) Vibration. Typically, standard PLCs can withstand vibration frequencies between 10 and 55 Hz, with an amplitude of 0.5 mm and an acceleration of 2 g. They are also designed to endure shocks up to 10 g. Exceeding these limits can lead to loosening of internal mechanical components, poor connector contact, and fatigue-related damage to electrical parts. Therefore, PLCs should be kept away from sources of intense vibration. If the operating environment includes strong vibration sources, it’s essential to implement vibration-damping measures—such as using vibration-absorbing rubber pads—to protect the equipment. (4) Air. The PLC's operating environment must be free from corrosive or flammable gases, dust, conductive particles, moisture, organic solvents, and salt deposits, as these can lead to PLC malfunctions, poor electrical contact, degraded insulation performance, and even internal short circuits. If operation in such an environment is unavoidable, the PLC should be installed inside a well-sealed control room or control cabinet. (5) Power supply. The power supply is one of the primary pathways through which interference enters the PLC. In environments with strong interference or where high reliability is critical, you can add a shielded isolation transformer, or alternatively, connect an LC filtering circuit in series. Mechatronics System Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance Case Study Tutorial",text-EN.txt
629,"174 The power section, control section, PLC, and I/O power supply should each have separate wiring. Isolation transformers must be connected to the PLC and I/O power supply using twisted-pair cables. Additionally, the system's power cables should be sufficiently thick to prevent voltage drops in the circuit when large-capacity asynchronous motors are started. 2. Daily Inspection and Maintenance of PLCs PLCs are composed of semiconductor devices, and aging is an inevitable phenomenon after prolonged use. Therefore, PLCs should undergo regular inspection and maintenance. Typically, inspecting and maintaining them once or twice a year is ideal; however, if the equipment operates in harsh environmental conditions, the frequency of inspections and maintenance should be increased based on actual circumstances. In daily operations, users should regularly wipe down the PLC’s surface and clean between its wires with a dry cloth to remove dust and debris, ensuring a tidy and hygienic working environment. The main inspection items include the following: (1) Check the power supply. At the power terminals, verify whether the voltage variation falls within the permissible range of ±10%.",text-EN.txt
630,"(2) Work environment. Focus on checking whether temperature, humidity, vibration, dust, interference, and other factors meet the standards for a proper working environment. (3) Input and output power supplies. The range of voltage variation at the corresponding terminals can be measured to ensure compliance with requirements. (4) Inspect the installation status. Check whether the wires connected to each module and the cables between modules are loose, verify that screws on external components are not loosened, and ensure that no components have aged or deteriorated. (5) Check whether the backup battery voltage meets the standard and if metal components show any signs of rust. During inspection and maintenance, if any non-compliant conditions are identified, promptly adjust, replace, repair, and document them for future reference. 3. Classification of Common PLC System Faults Common PLC system faults can generally be categorized into the following types, which can help people analyze where the failures occur. Position and the reasons behind it.",text-EN.txt
631,"(1) External equipment failure. These failures originate from external devices such as various sensors, switches, actuators, and loads. When these components fail, they directly im pact the system's control functions. Typically, the occurrence of such failures is determined by the quality and lifespan of the equipment itself. (2) System failure. This is a wid espread malfunction that affects the overall operation of the system. System failures can be categorized into permanent faults and transient faults. If restarting the system after  the failure restores it to normal operation, the issue is classified as a transient fault. Conversely, if a restart does not resolve the problem and hardware or software replacemen t is required to restore functionality, the failure is considered permanent. Such failures typically arise from improper system design or prolonged operational life of the system. (3) Hardware failures. These failures primarily involve damage to system modules such as the CPU, memory, power supply, I/O modules, and others—especially I/O modules. Such failure s are usually quite noticeable, and their impact is typically localized.",text-EN.txt
632,"It is mainly caused by improper usage, prolonged use, or aging of components within the module.",text-EN.txt
633,"(4) Softwar e failures. These types of failures are caused by errors inherent in the software itself, primarily due to inadequate consideration during software design. A  ""trigger, "" once executed, will be activated when the specified conditions are met. In practical engineering applications, due to the complexity and heavy workload of software development, s oftware errors are almost inevitable, which highlights the critical issue of software reliability. Understanding the status indicated by the PLC's LEDs is highly beneficial for dai ly fault diagnosis and program analysis. Here’s how to identify faults based on the status indicators on the PLC: (1) After the PLC power is turned on, if the POWER indicator light  is on, it means the power supply is functioning properly. If the POWER indicator light remains off, it indicates a fault in the power supply unit; in this case, you should promptl y check whether the power cable is disconnected or if there’s poor contact at the terminal connections. (2) When the system is in running or monitoring mode, if the RUN light on th e host does not illuminate, it indicates a fault in the basic unit. (3) When a particular input contact is activated, the corresponding input channel LED does not light up, indicat ing a fault in the input module. When the output LED lights up but the corresponding output contact fails to actuate, it indicates a malfunction in the output module. Chapter 5: Fa ult Diagnosis and Repair of Electrical Systems 175 (4) When the BATTERY light is on, it indicates that the lithium battery voltage is insufficient and should be replaced promptly. (5) When the ERROR light is flashing, it may indicate a program syntax error, an internal PLC malfunction, external interference, or insufficient lithium battery voltage. (6) When  the ERROR light stays on steadily, it indicates that the PLC is malfunctioning. The monitoring timer then resets the CPU to resume normal operation. This situation may be caused by  interference or an internal fault. The number and functions of status indicators vary among PLCs from different manufacturers; refer to the product manual for details on their spe cific functions when using them.",text-EN.txt
634,4. Interference in PLC Systems and Measures to Combat It,text-EN.txt
635,"Source of interference Interferences affecting PLC systems typically occur in areas where current or voltage changes dramatically. The primary reason is that changing currents generate magnetic fields, which in turn produce electromagnetic radiation that can interfere with equipment. Generally, electromagnetic interference can be categorized into common-mode interference and differential-mode interference, depending on the specific interference pattern. In PLC systems, the main sources of interference include the following: (1) Strong electrical interference. The PLC system relies on the power grid for its primary power supply. Since the grid has a wide coverage area, it is susceptible to induced voltages caused by electromagnetic interference from all surrounding sources, which can affect the lines directly. In particular, fluctuations within the grid itself, the switching of large electrical equipment, harmonics generated by AC/DC drive systems, and transient surges from grid short circuits—these phenomena can all propagate through transmission lines back to the power source. (2) Interference within the cabinet. High-voltage electrical components, large inductive loads, and cluttered wiring inside the control cabinet can easily cause a certain degree of interference to the PLC. (3) There are two types of interference introduced via signal lines: one is grid interference coupled in through the transmitter's power supply or the shared power supply for signal instruments; the other is external induced interference on the signal lines. (4) Interference caused by improper grounding systems. Proper grounding not only helps suppress the effects of electromagnetic interference but also mitigates The equipment emits interference outward; meanwhile, improper grounding can actually introduce significant interference signals, causing the PLC system to malfunction. (5) Interference originating from within the PLC system. This is primarily caused by electromagnetic radiation between internal components and circuits of the PLC system, such as mutual radiation among logic circuits and their impact on analog circuits. (6) Variable frequency drive interference. Harmonics generated during the startup and operation of the VFD can induce conducted interference in the power grid, leading to voltage distortion and degrading the quality of power supply. Additionally, the VFD's output produces significant electromagnetic radiation interference, potentially disrupting the normal operation of nearby equipment. 2) Major Anti-Interference Measures (1) Use a high-performance power supply to suppress interference introduced by the power grid. In PLC systems, the power supply plays a critically important role. Grid-induced inte rference entering the PLC system primarily couples in through the PLC system’s power sources—such as the CPU power supply, I/O power supplies, and transmitter power supplies—as wel l as through the power supplies of instruments that have direct electrical connections to the PLC system. To minimize interference in PLC systems, isolation-type power supplies wit h excellent performance are typically employed for the system’s main power supply. (2) Properly select cables and implement segregated cabling. Different types of signals should be  transmitted via distinct cables, with signal cables routed in separate layers based on the specific type of signal they carry. It is strictly prohibited to use different conductor s within the same cable for simultaneously transmitting both power supply and signal—instead, power lines, control lines, as well as the PLC’s power and I/O lines, must be wired se parately. Additionally, keep the PLC’s I/O lines completely isolated from high-power lines. If routing must be done within the same cable tray, isolation panels can be added to min imize interference. (3) Hardware Filtering and Software Anti-Interference Measures. Before the signal is fed into the computer, connect a capacitor in parallel between the signal l ine and ground to reduce common-mode interference. Additionally, installing a filter between the two signal terminals can help minimize differential-mode interference. Mechatronics System Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance Case Study Tutorial",text-EN.txt
636,"176 Due to the complexity of electromagnetic interference, completely eliminating its effects is impossible . Therefore, when designing and configuring the software for PLC control systems, it’s essential to incorporate anti-interference measures at the software level to further enhance  system reliability. Commonly used techniques to improve the reliability of software structures include: digital filtering and power-frequency shaping sampling, which effectively su ppress periodic disturbances; periodically correcting the reference point potential and employing a dynamic zero point to prevent potential drift; implementing information redundan cy by designing corresponding software flag bits; and utilizing indirect jumps along with software protection mechanisms. (4) Properly select grounding points and optimize the grou nding system. The purposes of grounding are: first, to ensure safety; and second, to suppress interference. A well-designed grounding system is one of the key measures for enhancin g the PLC system's resistance to electromagnetic interference. (5) Suppressing Interference from Frequency Converters. Typically, interference from frequency converters can be addr essed in the following ways: Installing an isolation transformer, which primarily targets conducted interference originating from the power supply and effectively blocks most of this interference before it reaches the converter. Using filters, which offer strong anti-interference capabilities while also preventing the converter’s own internal noise from being fed back into the power supply. Some advanced filters even incorporate functions to absorb voltage spikes. Employing output reactors—by adding an AC reactor between the frequency converter and the motor, this approach helps minimize electromagnetic radiation generated by the converter during energy transmission, thereby reducing its impact on the proper operation of other connected equipment. 5. Wiring Issues in PLC Systems",text-EN.txt
637,"1) Requirements for on-site wiring Taking Siemens PLCs as an example, the S7-200 PLC uses wires with a cross-sectional area of 0.5 to 1.5 mm². When wiring, it's best to use wires in pairs—pairing one neutral or common conductor with either a control wire or a signal wire. Additionally, keep AC lines separate from DC lines that carry large currents and experience rapid fluctuations, as well as from low-voltage signal lines. In cases of significant interference, be sure to install appropriate surge suppression devices. 2) PLC Grounding Issues Good grounding is one of the measures to enhance PLC immunity against interference. When grounding a PLC, it's best to use a dedicated grounding wire. If it’s necessary to share the grounding system with other equipment, connect your own grounding wire directly to the common ground electrode. Under no circumstances should you share the grounding system with high-capacity motors or high-power thyristor devices, as this could lead to unexpected currents that might cause logic errors or even damage the equipment. 3) PLC Power Handling (1) Power Supply. PLCs typically use mains electricity as their power source. However, voltage surges and fluctuations from the power grid can directly affect the reliability of the PLC's real-time control. To enhance system reliability, an isolation transformer can be incorporated into the power supply system to block various interference signals from entering. Use overcurrent protection devices, such as circuit breakers, to safeguard the CPU's power supply and I/O circuits. You can also install fuses separately for output points grouped together or for individual points. Finally, after all ground terminals are connected collectively, use a 1.5 mm² wire to link them at the nearest grounding point. Grounding: Connecting the M terminal of the sensor power supply to ground will provide the best noise suppression effect. When the PLC is powered by a 24 V DC supply, an isolation transformer can typically be used for electrical isolation as well. (2) Internal Power Supply. The CPU module of the S7-200 PLC provides a 24 V DC sensor power supply and a 5 V DC power supply. The 24 V DC sensor power supply powers the CPU module, expansion modules, and 24 V DC user devices. If the required load current exceeds the rated capacity of this power supply, an additional 24 V DC power source should be added to supply power to the expansion modules. The 5 V DC power supply is provided by the CPU module to the expansion modules; however, if the expansion modules' demand for 5 V DC power surpasses their rated capacity, the number of expansion modules must be reduced. The 24 V DC sensor power supply for the S7-200 PLC cannot be used in parallel with an external 24 V DC power source; if connected in parallel, This could lead to the failure of one or both power sources, resulting in incorrect PLC operation.

640,"4) Handling Inductive Loads Inductive loads have energy-storing properties; when the contacts open, they generate a back electromotive force that can be several to dozens of times higher than the supply voltage. Conversely, when the contacts close, contact bounce may cause arcing—both phenomena can introduce interference into the system. To address this issue, the following measures can be taken: (1) If the load is DC, a diode can be connected in parallel across the load (with the cathode connected to the positive terminal of the power supply). A 1 A diode with a reverse voltage rating at least three times higher than the load's supply voltage should be used. (2) If the load is AC, connect a resistor-capacitor absorption circuit in parallel with the load. The resistance value of this RC absorption circuit can be set between 100 and 120 ohms, and its power rating should exceed the product of the peak voltage and operating current of the load’s power supply. The capacitance C can be chosen as 0.1 F. Right, the breakdown voltage should be higher than the peak voltage of the load power supply.",text-EN.txt
641,"6. How to Use the Self-Diagnosis Function to Identify Faults If a PLC system fails during operation, as long as the central processing unit (CPU) is functioning, it can rely on its built-in self-diagnostic capabilities to identify the fault. The PLC's self-diagnosis offers a wide range of functions for fault detection and debugging. However, due to PLC manufacturing… Manufacturers vary, and so do the models—resulting in somewhat inconsistent self-diagnostic capabilities. Specifically, what exactly are the self-diagnosis features of a particular PLC model? Yes, you’ll need to refer to the corresponding manual. A PLC system can generally provide self-diagnostic functions in the following areas: (1) Faults are identified by analyzing the system status word and control word. Typically, users can directly read the contents of these words on the screen using programming software. The status word provides insights into whether the hardware and software configuration is properly arranged, as well as whether I/O addresses, expansion racks, or other components are in use—or if a fault has occurred. Additionally, by examining the read values, it’s possible to pinpoint issues related to specific address numbers, racks, slots, or even individual I/O points. As CPU performance continues to improve, PLCs are now capable of providing an increasingly detailed status word, enhancing their self-diagnostic capabilities even further. (2) Use the PLC’s interrupt or stack functionality to diagnose faults. The interrupt and stack are specific data storage areas within the PLC’s operation; they are automatically generated and made available for display when invoked by the system’s self-diagnostic software. Users can also manually access their contents to identify and troubleshoot issues. (3) Use the PLC programmer to diagnose faults. The PLC programmer offers a range of debugging and diagnostic features, including internal… Functions include comparison, system parameter modification, program comparison, self-program verification, runtime status testing, input status testing and display, as well as forced operation and simulation of output states. By utilizing these features, users can identify errors and faults during program debugging or trial runs. 7. PLC System Fault Detection In a PLC system, there are numerous devices that require detection and control, and during the production process, these various devices (components) can potentially experience fai lures or malfunctions, leading to production losses. Therefore, automatic fault detection and tracking capabilities are essential for promptly identifying and addressing issues. Wi thin PLC-based systems, fault detection typically employs three fundamental methods: direct detection, judgment-based detection, and tracking detection. In practical system design,  different methods can be combined according to the specific requirements of the application, enabling enhanced effectiveness. (1) Direct Detection Method. The direct detection met hod for faults involves identifying whether a device is malfunctioning by analyzing self-contradictory logical relationships between signals from the equipment or its sensing compo nents. For example, the normally closed and normally open contacts of switching elements, operational commands versus their corresponding feedback signals, or the timing signals th at determine whether a device is permitted to act—all these pairs represent interconnected or conflicting information. By applying logical analysis to these interactions, it become s possible to determine whether the relevant equipment has entered a faulty state. Mechatronics System Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance Case Study Tutorial 178 For instance, in a certain system, a switch has two output contacts—normally open and normally closed—w hich are connected to PLC inputs I0.0 and I0.1, respectively. These two contacts can never simultaneously output a high or low signal; otherwise, it would definitely indicate a fau lt condition. The direct detection method for faults is commonly used to identify issues with individual devices—it’s simple and easy to implement. (2) The judgment-check method. T his method involves assessing whether a piece of equipment is operating normally by examining the logical relationship between its current state and the control process. For instan ce, if a particular device should have reached a specific position at a certain point in the control process but has instead failed to do so, this clearly indicates that a malfunct ion has occurred. For example, suppose a cylinder’s output port is Q0.0. After the command is issued, the cylinder should extend fully within 10 seconds—meaning the position sensor  connected to input port I0.0 will receive a high-level signal during this time. When diagnosing whether the cylinder is functioning correctly, users can design an 11-second timer  triggered by Q0.0. If the timer expires without the cylinder reaching its final position, it can be concluded that the cylinder is likely malfunctioning. This diagnostic method is  particularly useful for detecting faults in critical components of more complex conditional control systems, provided the user has a thorough understanding of the system’s overall  operational process. (3) Step-by-Step Tracking Method. The step-by-step tracking method for fault detection involves dividing the entire system’s control process into several discrete control steps. By checking whether the interlocking conditions between these steps are met, this method identifies potential faults within the system. Specifically, if a fault occurs during any particular step, the program halts at that point and automatically switches to the fault-detection routine. This routine then systematically evaluates all interlocking conditions associated with the faulty step, pinpointing the exact source of the issue and alerting maintenance personnel to carry out the necessary repairs. This approach is particularly suited for sequential control systems where operational steps are clearly defined and the control process can be paused temporarily—but it does require relatively complex programming.

As shown in Figure 6.18, the DC input circuit works as follows: When the external switch is closed, the PLC's internal optocoupler's LED lights up, causing the phototransistor to saturate and conduct fully. This conduction signal is then transmitted to the processor, enabling the CPU to recognize that a signal has been input on this channel. Meanwhile, when the external... When the switch is open, the LED in the optocoupler turns off, the phototransistor cuts off, and the CPU detects no signal on that channel.

707,"Figure 6.18 DC Input Circuit The AC input circuit is shown in Figure 6.19. As you can see, the main difference from the DC input circuit is the addition of a rectification stage. The typical input voltage for AC input is 220 V AC. After passing through resistor R to limit the current and capacitor C for isolation (which removes the DC component from the power supply), the AC signal is converted into DC via a bridge rectifier. After this step, the circuit operates on the same principle as a DC input circuit. Figure 6.19: AC Input Circuit From the analysis above, it can be seen that because the AC input circuit incorporates three additional stages—current limiting, isolation, and rectification—the delay time of the input signal is longer compared to a DC input circuit, which is its main drawback. However, since the input end operates at high voltage, the reliability of the input signal is significantly higher than in DC circuits. Typically, AC input methods are used in harsh environments characterized by oil mist, dust, or other challenging conditions where high response times are not critical. In contrast, DC input methods are preferred for cleaner environments with minimal electromagnetic interference and applications that demand faster response speeds. To illustrate this, let’s examine Mitsubishi PLC manufacturers’ definitions of sink and source configurations. 1) Open-collector input circuit The leakage-type input circuit is shown in Figure 6.20, where current flows into the PLC common terminal (COM terminal) and out from the input terminal—meaning the PLC common terminal is connected to the positive pole of an external DC power supply. 2) Source-type input circuit The circuit shown in Figure 6.18 is also a source-type input circuit. In this case, the current flows in the exact opposite direction compared to a sink-type circuit. In a source-type input circuit, current flows into the PLC's input terminal and out through the common terminal—meaning the common terminal is connected to the negative pole of the external power supply. Case Study Tutorial on Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Mechatronic Systems",text-EN.txt
708,"192 Figure 6.20: Common-Collector Input Circuit 3) Hybrid Input Circuit Because this type of PLC input terminal and common terminal can both source and sink current—meaning the PLC common terminal can be connected to either the positive or negative terminal of an external power supply—it simultaneously exhibits characteristics of both source-type and sink-type input circuits. Therefore, this type of input circuit is referred to as a hybrid input circuit. Its circuit configuration is illustrated in Figure 6.21. Figure 6.21: Hybrid Input Circuit When used as a source-type input, connect the negative terminal of the power supply to the common terminal; when used as a sink-type input, connect the positive terminal of the power supply to the common terminal. This allows wiring according to site-specific requirements, making the wiring process more flexible. It should be noted here that Mitsubishi and Siemens have exactly opposite definitions for source-type and sink-type input circuits. The explanation above follows Mitsubishi's classification method, so please keep this distinction in mind when using the system. 2. Connecting External Digital Signals to the PLC In addition to dry-contact signals like those from buttons, PLCs now also accept NPN and PNP collector-open output signals from certain sensors. Connecting dry contacts to the PLC input module is straightforward, so we won’t go into detail here. However, when it comes to choosing between NPN or PNP sensors for different PLC input circuits, users sometimes find themselves unsure of which to select. Below, we’ll explain how these two types of sensors connect to PLC input circuits. The configurations of NPN and PNP output circuits As shown in Figure 6.22, the output terminal OUT of the NPN collector-open circuit is connected to 0V through a switching transistor. When the sensor activates, the switching transistor saturates and turns on fully, connecting the OUT terminal directly to 0V and generating a low-level 0V signal at the output. The PNP collector… The output terminal OUT of the open-circuit output circuit is connected to +V through a switching transistor.

Figure 6.23: NPN Collector-Open Output and PLC Connection (2) PNP collector open-collector output. The PNP collector-open output provides a +V high level; when the output terminal OUT is connected to the PLC input, current flows into the PLC input and out through the PLC's common terminal. This configuration represents the PLC's source-type circuit form—specifically, the PNP collector-open output can only be connected to PLCs with either a source-type (where the common terminal is tied to the negative side of an external power supply) or a mixed-type input circuit, as illustrated in Figure 6.24. Figure 6.24: Connection Between PNP Collector-Open Output and PLC – A Case Study on Fault Diagnosis and Maintenance of Mechatronic Systems 194 Precisely because of the diversity in PLC input module circuit configurations and the variety of output signals from external sensors, it is essential to thoroughly understand the type of PLC input circuit and the format of the sensor's output signal before wiring the PLC input module. 6.5 Case Study on Electrical System Motor Failures",text-EN.txt

To ensure that any safety-related faults are promptly addressed, always follow the instructions outlined in this manual when operating the robot. Huashu Robotics Co., Ltd. is commi tted to providing reliable safety information but assumes no responsibility for it. Even when all operations are carried out strictly according to the safety instructions, there is  still no guarantee that the robot will not cause personal injury or property damage. 1.1 Instructions for the Safe Use of Robots Before installation, operation, maintenance, or ma jor repairs, be sure to familiarize yourself with this book and other accompanying documents, and use the product correctly. Please thoroughly review the equipment guidelines, safe ty information, and all relevant precautions before using the product. 1.1.1 Safety Precautions During Adjustment, Operation, Maintenance, and Related Processes (1) Operators shoul d wear work uniforms, safety helmets, safety shoes, and other appropriate protective gear. (2) Before powering on, ensure there are no operators within the robot's operational rang e. (3) When the robot is in automatic mode, no personnel are allowed to enter the robot's operating area. (4) Operators must disconnect the power supply before entering the robot's  operational area. Additionally, they should carry the teach pendant at all times to prevent unauthorized or accidental operation by others. (5) Whenever live electrical work such  as repairs or maintenance is required, two people should operate together: one person should always be ready to press the emergency stop button. One person operates the button, whi le the other carefully and swiftly carries out the task within the robot's operational range. Additionally, the retracing path must be confirmed before starting the作业. (6) The load  on the wrist and robotic arm must be kept within the allowable capacity range. Failure to comply with the permitted load limits may result in abnormal movement of mechanical compo nents or premature damage. (7) Use a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher in case of fire. (8) The emergency stop button must not be short-circuited. (9) Please read the instructions i n the  ""Precautions "" section of the  ""Mechanical Operation and Maintenance Manual. "" (10) Do not disassemble or operate any components not mentioned in the service manual. The robot is equipped with multiple self-diagnosis and anomaly detection features, allowing  it to safely shut down in case of an abnormality. Nevertheless, accidents caused by the robot still occur from time to time. These conditions are commonly found in robot accidents : (1) Perform automatic operation, ensuring no one is within the robot's range of motion. (2) After entering the robot's motion range for automatic operation mode, the robot unexpe ctedly moved.",text-EN.txt

(7) The robot-carried workpiece fell and scattered all over the floor. (8) When the workpiece is clamped, the robot loses contr ol and enters an interlocked standby stop state. (9) The robot located next to or behind this robot performs the action. The examples above are just a few; in reality, ""emergencies"" can take many different forms. In most cases, people simply cannot ""stop"" or ""avoid"" these robots in the midst of sudden operations, so it’s crucial to immediately implement the following countermeasures to prevent such incidents from occurring. Attention: No approaching the robot. When the robot is not in use, ensure it cannot operate by pressing the ""Emergency Stop"" button or disconnecting the power supply. During robot operation, please assign a third-party monitoring personnel who can immediately press the emergency stop button to ensure safety. The robot must operate under the condition that the emergency stop button can be pressed at any time during operation. To comply with these principles, the latter's preventive measures must be thoroughly understood and strictly followed. 1.1.2 Safety Measures for the Robot Body When designing robots, unnecessary protrusions or sharp components should be eliminated, materials suitable for the working environment should be selected, and fail-safe protective structures should be incorporated to ensure the robot remains durable and prevents accidents during operation. Additionally, to ensure safety, robots should be equipped with malfunction detection and shutdown features, as well as an emergency stop function, while also incorporating interlock mechanisms to prevent risks triggered by peripheral equipment. When safety features or protective devices are turned off or removed, the robot must not operate. When installing the included machine onto the end effector or robotic arm, strictly follow this manual and use the bolts specified in the manual—both in terms of type and quantity. Be sure to tighten them using a torque wrench to the exact torque setting provided. Additionally, rusted or dirty bolts should not be used. Failure to tighten according to the specified or improper methods will lead to bolt loosening, which could subsequently cause a serious accident. When designing and manufacturing end effectors, ensure that the relevant data complies with the allowable load values of the robot wrist components. Adopt a fail-safe protection mechanism to ensure that, in the event of a power or compressed air supply failure at the end effector, the gripped object will neither be released nor drop. Additionally, pay attention to edges and protruding parts to prevent injury to personnel or damage to items. Providing power sources, compressed air, or welding cooling water that do not meet specifications is strictly prohibited, as this can compromise equipment performance, lead to abnormal operations, and even trigger dangerous situations such as malfunctions or damage. Although electromagnetic interference depends on its type or intensity, current technology still lacks effective countermeasures. When operating or powering up the robot, please follow the safety guidelines carefully. Additionally, recorded data may be lost due to factors such as electromagnetic interference, other types of noise, or substrate defects. Therefore, please back up the program or constants to an external storage medium, such as a CompactFlash card. In large systems where multiple operators work simultaneously, operators should use gestures—or other polite communication methods—to accurately convey their true intentions when needing to interact over long distances. Noise and other environmental factors can undermine communication effectiveness and even lead to accidents. Industrial robot gestures (example) Operators should always be prepared to evacuate from hazards during the work process. This way, they can escape danger in an emergency. Always focused on the robot's movements, unable to re-engage with the robot. Delayed responses from robots can also lead to accidents. In case of an emergency, please immediately press the emergency stop button. This clause must always be strictly adhered to. Based on the site conditions and operational tasks, prepare job procedures and checklists covering robot startup methods, operating instructions, and troubleshooting steps, and ensure strict adherence to these procedures during execution. Relying solely on operators' memory or experience for operations will lead to accidents due to their forgetfulness and mistakes. When the robot doesn't need to move or perform any actions, please disconnect the power supply to continue operation. Before teaching, confirm the number of procedures or steps, then proceed with the operation.",text-EN.txt
726,"Incorrectly editing the program or steps will lead to accidents. Use the storage protection feature to safeguard completed programs against accidental editing. After completing the teaching operation, manually check the robot's status at low speed. If the robot is immediately operated in automatic mode at 100% speed, factors such as program errors could lead to accidents. After the teaching operation is completed, cleaning should be carried out immediately, and ensure that all tools have been put away. Any oil spills or leftover tools in the work area can easily lead to safety hazards such as slips and falls. Ensure safety during the cleaning process. Please secure the robotic arm before removing the motor. Please secure the robotic arm before removing the motor. 1.2 Transporting, transferring, or selling the robot Unless the original sales contract includes specific provisions, safety-related terms will not be inherited by the new recipient when the robot is transported, transferred, or sold overseas. The original customer should sign a new contract with the new successor. When transporting, transferring, or selling this robot, please ensure that the operation manual, maintenance guide, and any other relevant documents included with the device are also handed over to the new user. Customers are responsible for preparing operation and maintenance manuals in the appropriate language, as well as changing the display language, when shipping, transferring, or exporting robots to foreign countries—and must also ensure compliance with local laws and regulations. New users, without reading the operation manual, may perform improper or unsafe actions, potentially leading to accidents. 1.3 Abandoned Robots Do not disassemble, heat, or incinerate the batteries used in control devices and the robot body, as this may cause fire, rupture, or combustion. After disassembly, do not discard the control unit's baseplate and components directly, as sharp edges from cracks, cuts, or other damaged areas, along with exposed wires, could cause injury. Please remove the cables and external circuit wires from the connectors and junction boxes, then discard them directly—no further disassembly is required. Otherwise, operators could risk cuts to their hands or eyes from sharp conductors or other objects. Please exercise caution during the disposal process to avoid pinching or getting injured. Discarded items should be disposed of safely. To prevent environmental pollution, waste materials such as used batteries and waste oils should be properly managed according to local environmental regulations. 2 Basic Instructions",text-EN.txt

To prevent damage to electrical components, make sure to implement proper moisture protection and avoid severe impacts, vibrations, shocks, and rough handling during transit. 2.4.1 Unboxing",text-EN.txt
730,"Upon receipt, please inspect the package contents and ensure the parcel is undamaged. Please carefully open the packaging to ensure the robot remains undamaged. After unpacking, do not forcefully bend, hang, or sit on the robot. Once the box is opened, remove the securing screws from the robot’s base—be sure to hold the robot firmly to keep it balanced and prevent it from falling. Please do not pull, hang from, or sit on the robot. The robot should remove the transport support frame before activating its mobility features. 2.4.2 Handling Method The lifting weight is approximately 280 kg (excluding peripherals, handling fixtures, and pallets). Please select a forklift or crane with sufficient load capacity, and ensure it is equipped with lifting slings of adequate strength. When operating the robot, be sure to avoid subjecting it to excessive shock and vibration. When moving robots using a forklift or crane, remove obstacles and other hindrances beforehand to ensure the robot is safely transported to its installation location. When handling robots using a crane or forklift, it is strictly prohibited to support the robot body directly with your hands. Please assign qualified personnel to perform lifting, crane operations, forklift driving, and other material-handling tasks. Operating without proper certification could lead to severe injuries or significant damage, posing an extremely high risk. When lifting the robot, please support it with your hands to maintain balance. If the robot falls due to unstable handling, it could result in serious injury or significant damage—extremely dangerous. When using the portable fixing device, be sure to remove it after use. When using the threaded holes installed with the handling fixture to mount other auxiliary equipment, the robot's range of motion will be limited—please ensure you carefully consider the actual operating conditions. In principle, cranes or forklifts should be used to move the robot. Before lifting with a forklift, the robot and its baseplate (pallet) must be secured, including using any provided fixing screws and inserting spring washers if necessary. Before the forklift begins moving, refer to Table 2.3 for the robot’s correct handling posture; specific details can be found in Figures 2.11 through 2.12. Table 2.3: Robot Pose During the Processing Procedure When using a crane for lifting, first adjust the robot's position (refer to Figure 2.3), then secure four M16 eye bolts at the robot base and one M10 eye bolt at the motor base. Additionally, protect the wire rope connection point between the robot and the crane with rubber hoses and foam blocks. Please note that the wire rope must never be connected to the motor or pipeline components—see Figure 2.11 for details. During lifting, always ensure the robot’s center of gravity remains above its midpoint; otherwise, imbalance could cause the robot to tip over. 2.5 Installation Set up a safety fence for robot operations, otherwise accidents such as physical injuries or equipment damage could occur. It is strictly prohibited to power on or operate the robo t when it is not securely stabilized, as this could lead to equipment tipping over, personal injury, and damage to the device. Please ensure that the ceiling or wall can support su fficient weight before mounting the robot upside down or on the wall. Additionally, consider implementing measures to prevent the robot from falling, thereby avoiding potential acc idents such as injuries to personnel or damage to equipment. Do not install or operate robots with damaged or missing components. After completing the setup, be sure to remove all  related accessories and tools from the robot, and stay outside the robot's maximum operating range before powering it on for the first time. 2.5.1 Safety Switch According to Articl e 5.4,  ""Robot Motion Restrictions, "" of GB11291.2-2013, the National Standard of the People's Republic of China titled  ""Safety Requirements for Industrial Robots—Part 2: Robot Systems and Integration, "" it is stipulated that  ""the design and integration of robotic equipment should minimize the potential exposure of personnel to hazards. "" Specifically, 5.4.2 emphasizes the need to establish a safety protection zone and carefully limit its scope, stating:  ""A safety protection zone must be defined through perimeter safeguarding measures. When designing this zone, full consideration should be given to the robot’s installation location  and layout, as well as all types of hazardous sources present within the safety area. "" Additionally, 5.5.2 further clarifies the requirements for intervention pathways:  ""For tasks requiring manual high-speed operation, the minimum clear distance provided must be no less than 0.5 meters. "" Finally, Article 5.10 on safety protection specifies:  ""When hazards cannot be completely eliminated by design or are insufficiently mitigated, appropriate safety protection measures must be implemented. Personnel entering hazardous ar eas must be equipped with safety devices such as guardrails, protective enclosures, or other suitable barriers to ensure their safety. "" During the automated operation of industrial robots, operators and nearby personnel may be injured by contact with the robot. To prevent injuries to people and damage to equipmen t during robotic operations, be sure to install safety switches or implement appropriate protective measures. (1) The safety fence should be sufficient to ensure the robot’s maximu m working space, ensuring that it does not interfere with the surrounding environment—even after the necessary fixtures are installed and the workpiece is securely clamped. (2) The  entrances and exits of safety fences should be minimized. Whenever possible, only one should remain open in principle, and a lockable security gate must be installed to prevent un authorized personnel from entering freely and avoid potential personal injuries. (3) The scope of the safety fence can be referenced in Figure 2.14, while the robot's operational r ange is shown in Figure 2.8. As for the fixture and workpiece, they will be determined based on the customer's specific requirements. 2.5.2 Installation Environment The installatio n environment is critical to the robot's performance. The installation environment is as follows: (1) The flatness deviation of the mounting surface should be controlled within 0.5 mm; (2) Installation temperature should be between 0°C and 45°C; (3) Install in an environment with humidity levels between 20% and 80%, ensuring no condensation occurs; (4) The installation altitude should not exceed 1000 meters; (5) The pollution category is Class III; (6) Areas free of flammable or corrosive liquids or gases; (7) Stay away from locations with strong sources of electrical noise; (8) Locations without significant impact or vibration. 2.5.3 Robot Installation and Fixing Dimensions A: Flange installation dimensions, see Figure 2.17 B: Attachment equipment installation area I, see Figure 2.18 C: Attachment Equipment Installation Area II, see Figure 2.19 D: Attachment equipment installation area III, see Figure 2.20 E: Attachment equipment installation area IV, see Figure 2.21 F: Robot base mounting dimensions, see Figure 2.22 2.5.4 Robot Installation Practice The robot base should be securely fastened to the mounting holes on the baseplate using 4 M16 screws; if necessary, please install additional positioning bolts. If you plan to mount the robot upside down or on a wall, ensure that the ceiling or wall can support its weight adequately. If the load-bearing capacity is insufficient, take appropriate precautions in advance to prevent the robot from falling, which could result in personal injury or equipment damage. For detailed installation dimensions of the robot base, refer to Figure 2.22. Mount the robot onto the mounting base, ensuring the base has sufficient strength and that the contact surface with the ground is perfectly flat—free of any protrusions or cracks. During installation, prioritize personal safety to prevent the robot from tipping over. When installing robots in inverted or side-mounted configurations, secure them with screws, and if necessary, add positioning bolts and anti-fall devices to further enhance safety. Additionally, during handling, lifting, or installation, never apply excessive force to the robot's forearm or wrist, as this could lead to damage due to overexertion. Finally, always prioritize your own safety when performing installation or removal tasks for side-mounted or inverted robots—take care to avoid injuries caused by collisions or pinching. 2.6 Robot-Allowed Payload This section focuses on robot payloads. If the relevant robot, torque, or inertia exceeds the allowable limits, please select a robot with a higher payload capacity, or contact our company for assistance. Please refer to Chapters 2.5.3 and 2.5.4 for the installation dimensions of the robot body.

However, be aware that exceeding the amount of leaked lubricant could lead to oil leaks or even affect the robot's motion trajectory and other issues. After maintenance or refueling, to prevent oil leaks, be sure to wrap sealing tape around the plug at the pipe thread before installation. Table 3.3: Lubricant Usage Replacement Chart It is recommended to use the provided robot positions when performing lubrication replacement or replenishment tasks. Table 3.4 illustrates the robot's orientation during the lubrication process. Table 3.4 Robot Pose To ensure efficiency, robots should be regularly lubricated and thoroughly inspected in accordance with the following guidelines. Mixing different types of lubricants can cause serious damage to the gearbox. When adding oil to the gearbox, never combine oils from different brands or models unless the instructions specifically recommend it. Always use only the type of lubricant specified by the manufacturer. Note: If the amount of oil injected exceeds the amount discharged, the excess oil could cause internal pressure to rise, potentially leading to oil leaks. In this case, after heating the robot, please open the vent to release the pressure and reduce the risk of oil leakage. If improper steps are taken when replenishing the lubricant, the pressure within the lubrication chamber could rise suddenly, potentially damaging sealing components, leading to lubricant leakage and abnormal equipment operation. After refilling or replacing, thoroughly remove any excess oil from the floor and the robot’s surface to prevent workers from slipping and causing accidents. Refilling and replacing J1-type lubricant (see Figure 3.1) (1) Move the robot to the position shown in Figure 3.4, turn off the power, and disconnect the plugs from the oil inlet and oil outlet ports.

If you need to replace the battery or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact us. To avoid zero-point drift, reset the robot to zero before replacing the battery. When installing the cover plate, do not squeeze the cables. Replacement steps: (1) Reset the robot to the zero point and press the emergency stop button—do not disconnect the power supply. (2) Remove the battery sealing plate, then pull out the battery; (3) Remove the old battery; (4) Insert the new battery into the plug, then place it into the battery compartment of the robot base. (5) Reinstall the battery sealing plate; (6) Check for the existence of zero; (7) If you replace the battery while the device is powered off, or if the zero point is lost after replacing the battery, please recalibrate the zero point. If the battery replacement does not reset the value to zero, or if the robot loses its zero reference after battery replacement for any other reason, refer to Section 3.5 for calibration instructions. For information on battery models and specifications, please contact us. 3.5 Zero-point Calibration This section focuses on the robot's zero-point reference position in case of zero-loss scenarios. The robot undergoes mechanical zero-point calibration before leaving the factory. If, due to a malfunction, the robot loses its zero position, it will need to undergo mechanical zero-point recalibration. For zero-point calibration procedures for standard robots HSR-JR615-2000, HSR-JR620-1800, and HSR-JR630-1800, refer to Figure 3.6. Please set the speed to low at the zero-point calibration. During zero-point calibration, please avoid having your hands caught in the robot's moving parts. 4 Fault Handling Robot design must meet the following requirements: In case of an anomaly, it must be able to immediately detect the issue and halt robot operation. Even so, Still prohibited from continuing operation, as the robot remains in danger. Robot malfunctions can be categorized into the following types: (1) Once this malfunction occurs, the robot will be unable to operate until the repair is completed. (2) Once this failure occurs, the robot can continue operating after a certain period of time. (3) If this malfunction occurs, immediately turn off the power supply; afterward, the robot will resume normal operation. (4) Once this failure occurs, the robot can immediately resume operation. (5) Robot malfunctions caused by system-side failures. (6) System-side anomalies caused by robot-side failures. Under conditions (2), (3), and (4), these failures are almost certain to occur again. Moreover, even experienced engineers may find it challenging to easily pinpoint the root cause of faults in complex systems. Therefore, when a malfunction occurs, immediately halt robot operation and notify a professionally trained safety operator, who will take responsibility for identifying the issue and carrying out the necessary repairs. Additionally, these procedures should be incorporated into operational guidelines, establishing a robust implementation mechanism to ensure that corrective measures are effectively put into practice—otherwise, accidents could still arise. When a robot exhibits abnormal movement or operation that isn't caused by the control system, check whether the issue stems from a mechanical failure. To quickly resolve the problem, first identify the situation and pinpoint exactly which component is responsible for the malfunction. Step 1: Which joint is affected by the abnormality? First, it’s important to identify exactly where the anomaly is occurring. If the surface-level abnormality isn’t enough to determine the issue, further inspection should focus on the area emitting the unusual sound, the region experiencing abnormal heat, and any areas with noticeable gaps. Step 2: Which part is the anomaly located in? After identifying the abnormal joint, further investigation is conducted to pinpoint exactly which part is affected. A single phenomenon can often result from the interaction of multiple components. Figure 4.1 illustrates the fault and its underlying causes. Step 3: Until the Invalidated Section After identifying the faulty component, proceed as outlined in Figure 4.3. If the cause remains unclear and it's uncertain how to address the issue, Please contact our company's service department.",text-EN.txt
